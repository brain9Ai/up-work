## 3. What techniques would you use to clean a data set?

**AI Agent-Specific Data Cleaning Techniques:**

### **Conversational Training Data Cleaning**
**Real Implementation from our WebAgent (94% accuracy):**
- **Intent Classification Cleanup**: Remove ambiguous conversations, standardize intent labels, balance training examples across all intents
- **Context Window Optimization**: Clean conversation history to maintain relevant context while removing noise that confuses the AI
- **Response Quality Filtering**: Remove low-quality responses, fix grammatical errors, ensure consistent tone and brand voice
- **Turn-taking Validation**: Identify and fix broken conversation flows, ensure proper user/agent alternation

### **Lead Data Quality Enhancement**
**From our 16,400+ lead processing system:**
- **Behavioral Data Standardization**: Clean engagement metrics (opens, clicks, responses) to create accurate lead scoring
- **Multi-source Identity Resolution**: Merge lead data across LinkedIn, email, and social platforms while preserving conversation context
- **Qualification Data Validation**: Clean company data (size, industry, revenue) to improve AI agent's personalization accuracy
- **Temporal Data Cleaning**: Handle time zone differences, sequence conversations properly, remove outdated lead information

### **AI Model Performance Data Cleaning**
**Techniques that improved our 94% accuracy:**
- **Outlier Detection in Response Times**: Identify and handle conversation delays that skew AI learning
- **Sentiment Consistency Validation**: Ensure sentiment labels match conversation content for better emotional intelligence
- **Feature Engineering Cleanup**: Clean and standardize input features (company size, role, industry) for consistent AI decision-making
- **Feedback Loop Data Processing**: Clean user feedback and correction data to continuously improve agent responses

### **N8N Workflow Data Quality**
**Production-tested on 20+ workflow systems:**
