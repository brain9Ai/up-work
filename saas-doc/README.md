## Project Overview

The Brain9 AI Agent Platform is a marketplace for AI Automation Tools and AI Agents that users can:
- Discover through search and filtering
- Subscribe to (free or paid plans)
- Configure for their specific needs
- Monitor and manage through a dashboard
- Access via API or SDK

The platform will feature a direct subscription model (no shopping cart), user authentication with Clerk, payment processing with Razorpay, and a comprehensive user dashboard for agent management.

## Referencing Current Codebase

The current website will serve as a reference for:
1. Design patterns and UI components
2. Color schemes and typography
3. Existing Anaya implementation details
4. API structure and integration patterns

This documentation outlines how to extract and adapt these elements for the new platform.

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture documentation
2. Set up infrastructure (Neon DB, Clerk, Razorpay)
3. Initialize the new repository with the recommended structure
4. Follow the implementation plan for phased development
