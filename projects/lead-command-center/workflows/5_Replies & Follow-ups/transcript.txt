hey what's up everyone Clarence here let me tell you a quick story six months ago I was drowning in work sending emails following up and trying to close deals by my definition I was truly hustling but it wasn't scalable so I needed a system fast forward to today I run a sixf figure agency earning over 50,000 a month thanks to the automation systems I built in NN these systems not only save me hours each week but also give me peace of mind knowing nothing falls through the cracks that's because these

systems never sleep and they never forget get anything unlike me today I'm sharing one of these systems with you an AI inbox manager that replies to leads while you sleep yes you heard that right this system will handle email replies on autopilot why is this necessary because I know many of you face the same problem I did whether you're just starting out or scaling your agency managing replies can be overwhelming and very very timec consuming so stick around because by the end of this video you'll have the tools

to build your own inbo automation system let's get into this all right let me paint a picture for you guys imagine this you've spent days crafting the perfect C emo campaign you hit send on that campaign and boom lead start replying you start seeing results results just like what you see on screen right now this is a screenshot or these are two screenshots out of my instantly account one of them is from a campaign I ran for a social media marketing agency and the other one is from a campaign that I ran for a web development or a

web design company you can see that both of the reply rates were around 7% for those who aren't familiar with C email reply rates that's about two times the market average so I'm pretty proud of this sadly not all of those replies were positive some weren't interested some were asking to unsubscribe from the email list let's say about the average of 37 and a half and 25% let's say about 30% of those replies were positive totaling me in 52 emails just for these two campaigns meaning I had to reply to

52 emails well I'm happy to reply to 52 positive emails but it takes up a lot of time and I also had another problem that problem being that all my targets live in the US and I live in Amsterdam so while they're responding 3 p.m. their time it is 3:00 a.m. for me so I would wake up to a flood of emails and by the time I had replied it was already too late leads went cold conversations fizzled and opportunities were lost now here is the important part in sales speed is everything shudy show studies

show that the faster you reply the higher the chance of closing the deal those critical first few hours after a reply are golden but in my case let's be real I couldn't sacrifice sleep to sit by my inbox all night hoping for a response this is a problem I faced early in my career I remember missing a reply from a lead who was ready to close on a $10,000 deal but because I didn't respond until the next day I missed that one and let me tell you that one stung very badly so I thought there has to be

a better way that is when I turned to automations I realized I could build a system to do the heavy lifting for me like categorize repes engage leads and keep the conversation alive all while I slept and today I'm going to show you how to do exactly the same now that we have set the stage let's talk about what we're building the goal is is simple create a system that manages your email replies so you don't have to this system will handle replies while you sleep keep your leads engaged and ensure you never

lose out on potential deals just like I did all the way at the beginning so here is the big picture for those who are not familiar with n8n which is the software you see on screen which I use as the glue to build all my automations uh with I've tried to break it down that's why I'm using these postage over there to kind of break down the entire system you see into much more easily digestible steps so first of all because this is an email inbox management we can only manage emails that we receive so we wait

for an incoming email that happens over here then the email needs to be classified it needs to be put into a category in this example I only chose three categories to keep it a bit simpler but you can work this out as you go along but this system as you see it right here live on screen takes care of 90% of what it needs to do then we'll have the AI write an email response based on the email they received so it needs to read the email properly and then lastly we have to send the email for sending the email I always use

instantly so I'll show you guys a quick preview of how that works and how to set up the API now that you guys have an understanding of what you can expect from this system and I've seen a little bit of a break down let me dive into how you can copy this for yourself and set this up for yourself so so if this would be a live system it would be triggered by a web hook but because it's very difficult to show you guys an example based on web hook I'm using an API from instantly to get me the emails I'll

quickly show you guys the API documentation on the instantly website because it's very straightforward here you go I mean you can read through the documentation if you'd like but all you'd really need to do from here is copy this code this C URL code take it like there and we open the HTTP request Noe and we just import the curl or C URL not really sure how you say it and then this is all filled in automatically in the API documentation uh you can see specifics of what this all means so let's say you only want the latest of

the thread of the email thread then you can only fetch that specific email you can set campaign IDs if you only want to receive or fetch emails from certain campaign IDs you name it and then on the right side the output side we see what our API call returned in this case it was a test email I sent to myself here Claren snap and what the email and tilt moving on I this is a step you can skip but because I always like to have everything synchronized so I also want my email system to be synchronized with

my CRM and for my CRM I use air table so I get the lead info because I need the record ID of the specific lead well in this case the lead being myself but I need the ID to further down the line if I want to update the status of the lead based on the email that they sent me or the email they replied with I need the record ID to then update it and update the correct record as you can see but I'll go over that uh in a bit so don't worry so once you've received the email form instantly and it's inside of your

workflow we need to filter the HTML this is a returning topic uh in my videos because most of the time something needs to be filtered somehow in this case it is the email as we can see on the left side this is the body of the email like the entire thread so also all replies and a lot of this everything within brackets and stuff is all code we don't need so we use this very similar to what I use to filter HTML websites and we get the filter text on the right which is only the text email addresses and dates

continuing on because in an email thread there is an email we sent and there's a reply so to keep things as simple for the large language models in this workflow as possible I wanted to split out the body of the email into each individual email that was sent back and forth in most case it would just be your C email or maybe your C email and your followup and then their reply and I wanted to split those out that's why I added this chat GPT note so inside of this chat GPT note on the left side we can see the

entire body of the email so the latest response and all of the previous that were sent as you can see there were a bunch because I did some testing back and forth and then this very simple prompt just tells the AI to split out based on some parameters and also output it as a Json which results in all the emails being split separately on the right side so for this workflow of today we're focusing on the most recent email which is the top one because it's in chronological order and the content of

the email was sounds great what is the price of all of this then we need to do some sentiment analysis we need a large language model in this case once again C GPT to kind of read the email and maybe the threat as a whole and identify what we need to reply to that all happens in this note over here so I'll quickly go over the prompt for you guys you are an email classifier designed to analyze incoming email from B2B called Outreach campaigns your goal is to accurately classify responses into predefined

categories well there are three categories like ready to schedule more info needed or not interested I'll go over these more in depth in a bit and then here I just input the most recent uh email email zero which corresponds to well as I said in chronological order the most recent one then below the system prompt I have defined the categories and I have given it some examples of the phrases that might be inside of such an email just to make the job of the llm a lot easier I've done this for the ready to schedule show

category I've done this for the more info needed and I have done this for the not interested important thing to note is that I've only asked it to Output whatever category it has assigned to the email in this case this was more info needed well that's the same conclusion I would have drawn from the email sounds great what is the price of all of this then I have placed a edit note this edit field is necessary to make my life a bit easier all I've done is taking this from the left so I wanted to identify the

content and I wanted to Output the end so the content over there and then output more info needed or in the case he would not be interested output not interested or if he sent over some dates that he was ready to schedule a meeting then I want him this to say schedule a meeting that is because of the next note the next note is a switch note all this switch note does is based on the exact output of this llm email classifier sent it down the appropriate flow so there are three options as I said there there

is the ready to schedule option there is the more info needed option and there was the not interested option by now I hope it's clear that the email we received was a request for more information namely the price obviously next in the flow is another error table note I already touched on the fact that here we get the record ID so inside of my CRM the status of this lead so the lead that responded to my Outreach would be changed to more info needed sent so I know that he replied to my message and

there has been a rep sent back to him so if I don't hear anything I can follow up manually or put him into a subsequence I'll be touching on the ready to schedule part of this flow and the not interested part of this flow a bit later on but because this example is about the more info needed and I also think that's the most interesting part of this workflow I'll just I'll finish this one first so once the status is updated of my lead inside of my CRM I've asked this llm this CET GPT node to do a quick

check because I've been doing business for quite a while I have a list of frequently asked questions which I have pre-written email responses to and I always ask the same whenever I onboard a client all of my clients already have existing businesses and they' have had a lot of calls they've had a lot of email communication most likely but let's say they just had a lot of calls and they know kind of the questions people might be asking when they tell about their services so you can do the same thing

you'll just compile a list of all of those questions and write some pre-written responses to those to then input that into a factor database and give the large language model access to that factor database so it can read the email identify the question in this case because there was more info needed and then look for the pre-written response and use that response to alter it maybe a bit and then send that back to your lead you could also of course skip the entire Factor database and just let the

AI read the email and write a response all by itself but I found that your output is a lot more consistent if you just give it examples and of course consistency is what we're looking for with this for those who are not familiar with a factor database a factor database is just like a giant storage in this case it's data about frequently asked questions and you can give the large language model access to that database to quickly search for whatever it needs to fulfill the task you're asking from

it I won't be diving too much in depth about the factor database in this video that's because I'm not really about howtos on this channel there is a lot of other videos on the internet about Factor databases and how you can upload things to them and how you can give the large ears model access to whatever you've uploaded but if I read love comments asking me to go further in depth about Factor databases I'll be sure to make a video about it so let me know if you have any questions before moving on I'll quickly go over the

prompt so the prompt as you can see is quite long but what I wanted to do is to analyze the context of the email I wanted to identify the question that's being asked and then check the factor database for a reply to that question there is the possibility that nothing in my Factor database matches that reply and in that case I want this to be sent off to a human via slack or the human being me in this case and I also want the output to be in a Json as you can see on the right side when it comes to

the question about the price I strongly suggest to not directly answer the question about the price my pre-written answer to that would be the pricing for Evis which is the name of my agency depends on the unique needs of your business I prefer to discuss how they can deliver the most value for your sales efforts before diving into cost it's recommended to schedule a call this goes for almost all information requests whenever someone asks more information about your services or about your cost and you give them that answer the

possibility of them never replying again is very likely I'm not really sure why so instead of giving them a clear answer always say you would love to give them more information but you'd rather get them on a call to talk about it and talk about the value you can add which is a lot better and get you a lot more actual meetings and actual meetings also resulting in more close deals than just straight up answering the question which I still to this day think is kind of strange so as I just said that there is

the possibility that the question being asked is not on my list is not in my Factor database if that is the case I want this to be sent off I want the question to be sent off to me so I can look at it myself and write a response instead of the AI just making something up that's why this if node is in place because if the question is not on my list it will output unavailable and then the if node will see if there's an unavailable present in the response yes or no and if it is present it will send

me a message on slack with the email reply from them so I can read it from my phone instead of having to go to my computer if the unavailable is not there and there is an answer I want the next large language model to read the information that was retrieved from my Factor database and write me an email response I'll show you the result so the pricing of FS surfaces depends on the unique needs of your business we prefer to discuss blah blah blah but just turns the pre-written answer into a tailored

message toward the uh recipient important thing to note is that there is some HTML in this response I did that on purpose as you can read in my prompt please provide the HTML content without any back ticks or code block markers you might be wondering why well this is because if you upload this message through the instantly API without any HTML in it it would just be one long line which doesn't look professional at all especially if you finish up with cheers clearance for example so be sure when you're automatically replying to

emails through the instant the API to use HTML to structure and properly format the email so you might be wondering why after there's a weight note and why there's this slack note that's because let's say you just built out this system you just copied me or you downloaded this flow out of my school community and set it up for yourself you want to test this out because a positive reply to your Outreach is very valuable so you don't want to mess it up because it can be very costly that's why I always suggest

if you have things like this and you're testing it out use a slack note or a telegram note or whatever so what happen happens is that the email response written by this large language model sends the email that has written to my slack so for me to review so it's kind of like a draft email I just get it in my slack inbox so I can check it on my phone very quickly see hey does this need some touches or can it be directly sent through the instantly API I mean if you run this for a few weeks you know if

there are any kinks or anything you need to tweak and if you think there aren't any things to tweak anymore you can just remove these slack notes and put the instantly API in their place and to answer the question about the weight notes well we need this to be as human as possible this flow would write a reply and send a reply within seconds and the recipient of those emails would most likely be very shocked and also think something was up because there's no way you can read write and send an email within seconds that's why we're

adding the human touch and having a bit of a time delay you can set this to like a static number let's say 15 minutes but I want to be a real human touch imagine this you've done some called Outreach someone asked for more information they received a reply asking them to schedule a meeting because I just told you guys you should always stare towards scheduling a meeting instead of answering the question straight up he would send a reply back to that email that would go to the upper flow the ready to schedule flow and he would

receive an email if the wait note would be set to 15 minutes each time he would receive two emails exactly being 15 minutes after he sent one which might raise some red flags and we want to avoid that at all cost that is why I use a custom line of code to give me a random number between 10 and 20 instead of a static number but that is such a minor detail you really don't have to worry about it I just like to think of myself as a bit of a perfectionist so that's why so the setup for the other two parts of the flow are very similar

so both in this case the ready to schedule case any not interested one we change the status of the lead accordingly in in our CRM for the not interested part of this flow I've written a standardized response I don't think it is best if someone has clearly shown they're not interested by explicitly saying it in their email or something like it to Pure them and keep on Hunting them I think you should be respectful so I always like to say hey thanks for the note lead name just for my own feedback what makes this not

interesting thanks a lot asking for feedback kind of gives you a bit of opportunity to continue on maybe there was something very specific about your called Outreach that didn't align with their Vision so if they respond back to this email you could maybe continue the conversation and try to win him over anyways and if he just says we already have this in house or whatever you can leave it at that and make sure you don't get into his spam folder for the rest of this sequence I already touched upon so

a wait note a select note to check or the HTTP request note which is just the instantly API then for the third and final subflow of this entire workflow do you ready to schedule one there is an pretty interesting part in my C Outreach I always send the link to book a meeting directly in my first email but I also ask them to send me over Sometimes some people are just too lazy or not technically savy to click the link or they don't want to press the link in a random C email so they'll send me over

sometimes that would make life a little bit more difficult but in this case it wouldn't because I've GI in the large language model access to my calendar so if I receive some times in the email it would go into this large language model which would check the availability one thing to note is that it would have to match time zones as I said earlier on in this video I'm from Amsterdam and most of my clients are from the US and even inside of the US there are different time zones so you have to give it

today's date my time zone and the users's time zone we know the users time zone because we know their location because it's inside of our CRM because we know that when we scraped the lead it's kind of like spying on someone that's pretty funny and then the prompt is kind of a stepbystep guide how I want the large language model to act I know that it probably could be a lot shorter so you guys don't have to copy everything word for word but I just found that this one never makes any mistakes while I've tried different

variations which were shaky at times so of course there are two possibilities when someone sends me over their available times either I am available or I'm not available if I am available it will send them an email back that I will schedule a meeting at that time if I'm not available the llm the large language model will have checked times that are very close to his suggestions which I am available at and it will send them back some of the times that I can actually make to make the entire process a lot

easier because I always send the link to book a meeting directly in my called Outreach them sending over times rarely happens but in casee it happens I have built this into my system and I would strongly advise you guys to just copy everything I did because this takes care of 99% of the email replies I receive and it will do the same for you I promise all right that was a lot but that was it you now have the blueprint to build your own AI inbox manager this system will help you stay on top of your

leads it will respond faster and it will close more deals in the end all without sacrificing sleep or without sacrificing in your own time I'm working hard every day trying to get my school Community up and running so you guys can download this workflow Json file because I've seen the comments I've read through them and I promise it's on its way if you found this video helpful please give it the like and make sure to subscribe for more automation tips also let me know in the comments what you like to see next I

want to thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in the next one bye
