imagine sending C emails and getting results like this a 4.7 reply rate and almost $400,000 worth of opportunities from a single gold outbound campaign it might sound impossible but you're wrong and today I'm going to show you exactly how I do it for those who don't know me I'm Clarence and I specialize in automated C Outreach systems I've personally skilled my lead generation agency from scratch to $80,000 per month leveraging nothing but AI driven C emails today I'm pulling back the curtain on exactly how I

achieve results like these in this video I'll walk you through the exact workflow I use every day to automatically write personalized opening lines for my C emails directly from LinkedIn post this method has been the single most powerful tactic for making my Outreach hyper relevant resulting in consistently high response rates the good news is that you don't have to build this workflow yourself I share this exact automation along with plug andplay Snippets and other proven workflows inside my scaling system

Society if you're serious about mastering C Outreach or scaling your business through reliable outburn strategies you'll definitely want to check it out the link is in the description below now let's dive straight into the workflow the goal here is simple we're automating hyper personalized called email Outreach using content directly from LinkedIn rather than sending send in generic emails that prospects immediately ignore we're taking the time consuming personalization step and automating it allowing you to achieve deep

personalization at massive scale the major benefit here is straightforward when your emails reference something personal recent and directly relevant to your prospect response rates Skyrocket prospects feel you've genuinely taken the time to understand them making them far more likely to engage to your Outreach this approach is exactly why I've been able to consistently achieve High reply rates book meetings effortlessly and generate significant opportunities with called Outreach let's jump into exactly how this workflow

achieves that so the first note in our workflow is called a web hook note the note is essentially the entry point or the trigger for our automation right now it is turned off because we're just showcasing it but normally this is where the workflow would start whenever I update the status of a lead in air table which is my CRM say marking a lead as ready for outreach air table automatically sends a small piece of information called a record ID to this web hook think of a record ID as a unique identifier that tells the

automation exactly which lead we're going to personalize the email for this means the moment I decide someone is ready for outreach the workflow immediately knows exactly which person's details it needs to pull next keeping everything smooth and automated from start to finish so the next step obviously being to pull the lead from the air table note meaning I collect all of the information that I have on the lead normally this note would use the record ID provided by a web hook to instantly pull in all the essential

details we need about their lead things like their name the company they work at their LinkedIn profile URL and other relevant details that already scraped but because the web Hook is currently off since I'm manually demonstrating this workflow for you we're just using static input right now meaning I've pasted the record ID manually as you can see the key thing to understand here is that this step gives us immediate access to all the information we need about the lead which we then use later in our

workflow to enrich their data and create hyper personalized emails automatically this is crucial because personalization at scale is exactly what makes this method so powerful and effective next up we have the scrape personal post note which is just a HTTP request Noe this is where the magic of data enrichment truly begins in this step we're using a tool called apify specifically the LinkedIn scraper available through apies platform to pull the latest LinkedIn post directly from the lead's personal

profile what is great about this specific scraper is that it doesn't require any cookies meaning you can scrape LinkedIn without worrying about getting flagged or baned it's completely safe and reliable once you've configured your scraper settings in apify which you can see is very little there are very little things to do you can press on Json copy this Json code and go back to n8n in NN you open the HTTP node you paste the Json code you just copied down here and you also have to paste the endpoint URL which is also on the ap5

scraper web page page the output we get from this step is structured Json data containing detailed information about each LinkedIn post it contains the text it contains if it's a repost yes or no the image URL and a lot of unnecessary redundant stuff as well but we'll filter that out later on we'll be using these posts as you can see there are five items so there are five post to automatically generate hyper personalized opening lines for or C emails this will significantly boost your engagement ratees in The Next Step

the workflow checks if the LinkedIn scraper found any post from the lead's personal profile all it does is look at the Json data we got from the previous scraper note and checks if it's empty or if it actually contains posts if there are posts available the entire data set moves forward to the next step but if the scraper found no posts at all this note outputs a clear signal literally a message stating no posts this allows us to use this result as a decision point in the next note the if note where the

workflow automatically determines what to do next based on whether posts were found or not this simple check helps us make sure we're never trying to create email personalizations from empty data because that would just look silly and would probably get you marked as spam in this if note we Face a critical decision whether the lead has any recent personal LinkedIn posts we can use not everyone is equally active on LinkedIn many people rarely post anything themselves so relying exclusively on personal boast

for email personalization isn't very realistic we need a solid backup plan that is why this if note checks the output from our previous step the verify posts availability if the lead has any personal post available we continue down the original path so you can see it marked in green to craft hyper personalized emails using their own content but if there aren't any personal posts which happens quite frequently we automatically switch to our backup plan scraping post from the lead's company LinkedIn page instead company Pages

usually have recent updates news or announcements we can leverage for personalization this ensures we can almost always find something relevant to include significantly boosting our response rates first we're following the Green Path in this next code note in this step we're preparing the data we've collected so far to make it easy for AI to handle when we scrape LinkedIn post using the scraper the scraper outputs each post as a separate individual item as I showed you earlier there were five items working with individual items can

quickly become messy and inefficient especially when feeding data into a llm a large language model that is why we have this crucial code note I called filter text and turn them into one what this note does is straightforward but extremely important it filters out reposts keeping only the original content created by our lead because reposts are generally Irrelevant for personalization because they're not actually written by the lead themselves and including them would confuse the llm besides filtering for reposts we also

filter everything that is irrelevant almost everything besides the post so on the left side you can see the post scraper included a lot of stuff like the amount of likes if it is public yes or no hashtags things like that and on the right side you can see the combined text so all of the text from the five posts because all of these five posts weren't reposts and you can see them split by the words new post so if you pause the video you can check that there are actually five LinkedIn posts inside of

this combined text now that we have a singular combined text string we can move on to the next note which is the llm node which will craft the personalization based on one of the posts to State the obvious I've called this note right personalization but it's just a simple basic chat GPT note which will analyze all of the incoming posts which it has access to as input and will craft me a personalized line let me quickly go over how it works we feed denote the lead's name and their company along with the Consolidated LinkedIn

post text we just prepared in the previous code note using this input the AI scans through all the posts to find the most relevant one specifically looking for mentions of the lead's name company or notable achievements let me quickly go over the exact prompt so you're an expert in personalized B2B called email Outreach given the LinkedIn posts provided separately identify the most relevant one focusing on mentions of the prospect's name company or northworthy achievements and complete the following sentence in a

concise engaging and conversational tone to use as an email opener came across your post on LinkedIn dot dot dot so that is the part that needs to be filled in by the AI provide only the completed sentence and no other explanation not having these guidelines could result in the AI outputting also the reasoning for why it picked that post and maybe even elaboration on why it thinks this is a good personalization and it would just look very messy if you would upload it straight into your email templates so

the structure of this prompt is pretty powerful because it clearly instructs the llm on exactly what kind of sentence we want ensuring the output feels natural conversational and engaging for as much as is possible to give you an idea of the result you can look at the output side uh it outputed came across your post on LinkedIn which is what we want to be static we always want that to the same I was really impressed by how Symon achieved a 5x Roi within just a few months with SAS rooms so if we

quickly look at the input you can see a few things so first of all it picked the first post the one where Symphony transforms SAS management with SAS rooms SAS rooms is the company from the lead as you can see the company name is SAS rooms lead's name is Philip but that is not relevant in this case so it recognized SAS rooms is Philips company which achieved a success story with Symphony and it decided to write something relevant about it which I think is a pretty good use case of using personal LinkedIn posts to write highly

relevant called email openers so by referencing a case study and also mentioning the company name of the lead the email instantly feels somewhat personal relevant and has a high chance of getting something engagement back which significantly boosts or response rates one thing to mention and what I think is great about keeping your prompt pretty concise is that it allows you to easily tweak and adjust the prompt based on your specific use case giving you complete control over the style and angle of personalization you prefer and

you want to be outputed by the llm but what happens if our lead doesn't have any personal posts on LinkedIn well as I said not everyone is Super Active on LinkedIn so it's important to have a reliable backup and that is exactly what we have here instead of scraping the leads personal LinkedIn profile we simply pivot to scraping the post from the company's LinkedIn profile we again use the apy LinkedIn scraper for this just as we did previously in this workflow but this time we replace the personal profile URL with the company's

LinkedIn URL once scraped we once again quickly verify whether the company has any original post we can use if yes we pass these along for personalization similar to the earlier step or the other path if not the automation moves directly to the final step indicating that there were no posts at all having a fallback like this ensures we always have the highest chance of finding relevant content to personalize or emails keeping response rates consistently high in the case the leads company would have any recent posts

available we proceed with the exact same approach letting a GPT node generate a personalized email opener referencing the company's content instead of personal post the inputs here remain simple we need their company name and the combined content of the company's recent LinkedIn posts the llm then has all the information it needs to generate a personalized and relevant opening line ensuring the Outreach remains engaging and authentic as I already mentioned there is also the possibility that there

are no personal posts and there are no original company posts if neither the lead nor the company has any recent posts the workflow automatically updates the air table record to indicate that there were no posts available this step just keeps it very easy for you to clearly see in your CRM in your lead list which ones have been reached out to and for which ones there weren't any posts available to write a opening line about by marking these leads clearly you can easily revisit them later perhaps

placing them into to another Outreach campaign with an alternative approach for example you could generate a personalized line based on their industry ensuring your emails remain professional targeted and still are somewhat effective and that is exactly how you automate hyper personalized C email Outreach using LinkedIn content as you saw at the start of this video this method is incredibly effective it helped me achieve a 4.7 reply rate and generated nearly $400,000 worth of opportunity from just one campaign
