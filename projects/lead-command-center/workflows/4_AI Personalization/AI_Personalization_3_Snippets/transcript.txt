So If You're Serious About automa Your outbound the right Way Check it out the link is in the description but for Now Let's Dive in the first snippet we're Looking At Is For scraping The company's homepage This Is Where we pull structured data about a company directly from the web site Which we can then Use To personalize outreach I'll Walk you through How This Works but first let's take a Quick Look at the Actual website We are scraping this is the homepage of Next Level a recruitment Agency The

workflow is going to extract Everything relevant From This homepage like Their mission Key Services product offerings and even client case studies if they mention Any If We scroll down you can see Oh There are some testimonials on the webpage They describe Their Own process and They even talk about some of the metrics that they are able to Achieve al Right Now that you know what we're Working with Let's Switch over to n8n and Check out the snippet first we have an Air table Note This Is Where we

pull in all the Lead information That's already in our CRM things like the personal LinkedIn URL The leads email address Their Company name URL to Their Company website and also The URL to LinkedIn organization Without These links we Wouldn't be able to scrape Any data Next we have the http noe This is what actually pulls in all the raw HTML from the homepage When We send a request to the website It Returns The entire page in code form Everything from text to styling Elements and scripts As you

can see on the right Side this Isn't Something we can use directly It's just a block of raw code filled with unnecessary Elements that don't add value to Our outreach If We Were to send this Straight into Our Ai processing step we Waste tokens on irrelevant data and increase costs so The Next Step is to clean up this raw HTML and extract Only meaningful text so That We Get A structured usable output the next Note filters The HTML And extracts Only The plain text The Reason We Do This is that l&m nodes have token and processing

unnecessary code would increase costs and reduce efficiency you can clearly see that all the HTML code has been filtered And Only The plain text That We were able to scrape from the website Remains now we Send this Clean text Into the first llm node Which gener a structured summary Of Everything We Just Scrap instead of dumping raw text into Our CRM this step should ensure that the information is organized fact based and actually useful outbound sales Here is exa promt I Use To Make The output is

structured readable and Ready For CRM upload The prompt tells The Ai to analyze the scrape data and extract Key details Like The Company Industry Their mission statement flagship Products and Any Unique Selling Points They highlight everything ites is Strictly based on What was on the homepage Nothing is G or fabricated so Let's Go through some Of The Key sections of this prompt First It pulls Basic Company details like the official name location and founding Year then It Looks for Core Services and

product descriptions along with Any notable clients or case studies mentioned It also scans for Industry Awards blog content or recent News Anything we can use for personalization Now let's take a look at an Actual example of The structured output since It is output in markdown It Might be a little difficult to read but if you look closely you can Now see How each section align was pulled from the homepage we can see headquarters we can see the Years founded we can see Their mission statement USB Core Services a lot Of

Stuff you can even see Awards or certifications Apparently The were the best place to work in 2022 so congratulations to them Now That We have a structured summary we move the next LM node this step takes The summar data and extract relevant variables we can use for email personalization instead of Just having a block of structured text We Are Now Breaking It Down to into specific data Points that can be inserted into outreach messages automatically so Here is the list of extracted variables some of these like

Company name and Industry are always available Because The Basic details Those Alone Don't make for compelling outreach the most valuable variables are the Ones that aren't Always guaranteed To Be There like recent funding rounds notable partnerships flagship Products or Key differenti These are the details that make an email stand Out And Feel highly relevant to the recipient So What do you do if a Key variable is missing A Simple but effective solution is to use A Waterfall Method instead of Ring On

Just One variable check for the most valuable data First If That's missing you move down the list and Use the next best alternative This Way Every email is still personalized even If some details aren't available this can be Done Inside NN using If Noes You First determine if a High value variable like recent funding round is present if it is you use it in the email If not you check For The Next Best alternative such as a case Study or a notable client this ensur that Every outreach email includes

Something relevant and specific without Ring On Just generic placeholders Once we have Our variables we can use Them To generate highly personalized outreach emails instead of Ring On Basic placeholders like First name and Company we're injecting Deeper More relevant Insights that make the message actually stand Out so I Written Down some examples to give you some understanding instead of saying Something generic like I came across your Company and want to connect we can Now say I noticed that Company name recently secured funding

round exciting Times we've helped other funded companies in Industry Skill Their outbound efforts and I'd love to share some Insights or instead of a typical value we can use many companies in Industry struggle with Key feature I Saw that Company name is leading the way with flagship product and I'd love to hear More about How You're tackling this Challenge this level of makes the outreach highly relevant increasing response Rat significantly It is the difference blending in and actually starting a Conversation as

Always after you Scrap The webpage created a summary and determined variables you push the structured data into Air table your CRM Which also had stored All Of The leads contact details because Without this step All data would go to waste adding Air The End updates CRM automatically new lead Comes with detailed inss Ready For outreach Any Manual Research that is how we scrape and structure Company homepage data Next I'll show you how we Take This a step further by extra data from LinkedIn to get even Deeper Insights into Our leads

this Next snippet Is as can essentially The processing webs weing a company LinkedIn page the key difference is that LinkedIn data is far more structured and reliable because unlike a website Where companies can format information however They want LinkedIn has set Fields that Every Company Fills in things like Their Industry Their employee Count founding Year and headquarters location that means We Get More consistent data making personalization a lot easier Just Like Before I'll quickly show the LinkedIn

page for Next Level So you can see what we're Working with the workflow will extract details from Here including Their listed surfaces Team size and other structured Insights They actually have a bunch of page posts Which Might be useful for personalization in the future you can see they have some Job openings even One For A sdr Meaning they're looking to grow this can All Be very useful for us in our outreach so Let's head back to n itn and Walk through this snippet As I mentioned since LinkedIn en Forces structured data

Fields we can confidently extract a Range of useful variables some of these like Company name Industry and location are always available LinkedIn also gives Us valuable Insights that Aren Always clearly listed on a website like the exact employee Count funding rounds if they Are Public and Any notable partnerships this structured data ures that Every outreach message is based up to date compy information instead of assumptions or very fake website descriptions Now let's take a look how we can use These variables in our

outreach instead of a generic introduction we can say I admire How Company name has Grown to employee Count since Years founded It's rare to see such consistent success in Industry or once again as a value driven pitch example I noticed that Company Name Is On A Mission to Mission statement many businesses in Industry are tackling similar challenges and I'd love to share a strategy that could Support Your growth by using structured LinkedIn data You Make sure your outreach Isn't Just personalized It is relevant and credible

now Let's move On To The Final snippet The Last snippet is focused on scraping a personal LinkedIn Profile unlike Company pages LinkedIn haster protection It Comes to personal accounts Just send a simple htp Request to grab the data to get Around this we need to use a Specialized tool an apy scraper a scraper is a tool that automatically extracts specific information from a webpage instead of manually copying and pasing details The scraper Simulator visiting The page and pulls structur data from it in this case we're using an

a scraper build specifically for LinkedIn profiles called the LinkedIn Profile scraper by Curious coder Check It Out If You're interested Before we Look at the workflow let's take a look at the personal LinkedIn Profile will be scraping because unlike Company pages The personal LinkedIn Profile contains details like Their work Experience skills education and Maybe even some endorsements now the apf scraper we're using is a tool Which allows Us to bypass LinkedIn restrictions and relia pool Profile data in a structured format

unlike previous snippets Where We Just Scrap All Of The HTML from the webpage The apf scraper already Returns Us very structured json output since The json is already structured we don't need to clean up text like Before but We Do need to format It properly into a single item The scraper Returns multiple separate Jons As you can see on the output side so we use a code noe to Convert The json output into a single piece of text this Just enses That We Can Use this as One singular input for the large language

model Which is used to analyze all of this data scraping a personal LinkedIn Profile gives Us Access to a Different set of variables some are always available like First name last name current Company and Industry but others depend on What the person chooses to display for example we can pull The Number of Years They been at Their current Company Their listed skills These detail use using outreach personal LinkedIn data can be extremely powerful for personalization it's also highly context dependent If reaching Out to a coach

consultant or personal brand referencing Their skills or Experience Might make Sense because Their personal background is ti directly to Their business reaching to aer Executive a high level Decision details personal LinkedIn Might intrusive and unnecessary in these cases Company level data is usually the Better Choice but When used correctly personal LinkedIn data Can Make outreach Feel highly relevant so Here are once again some examples of sentences using These variables That We Can pull from a

personal LinkedIn account First One Being Hi First name I came across your work at current Company and was impressed By Your Years Experience of expertise In The Industry or a congratulate message Like congrats on Years at current Company as current title at current Company your work in Industry Must Have given You Incredible Insights into top Skill or instead of a congratulate message Maybe you want to go for a value driven pitch I notice your Focus on top Skill at current Company many leaders in Industry are

facing similar challenges I'd love to share a solution that could streamline your processes Again the key is relevance if personal LinkedIn details add value to your outreach use Them if they Don't stick to Company level data that wraps up this breakdown we've Gone through How to extract data from a company's website Their LinkedIn page and even Their personal Profile each with Its Own strengths and best use cases Key takeaway Should Be The More relevant your outreach The Better your results personalization is Just about
