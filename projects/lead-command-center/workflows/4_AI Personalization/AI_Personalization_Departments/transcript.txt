that Slow Down outreach teams and Today I'm breaking down a workflow that gives you Ultimate flexibility in email personalization this Isn't Just A concept It is the exact system I Use In My Own Agency to make highly personalized c outreach effortless if you want to copy this workflow Without having to build it from Scratch It is Inside my private school Community That's where I share all my Business sops automation workflows and n templates including This one so If You're Serious about scaling outreach

Without spending Hours on setup everything you need is Inside Now that you know why this system is a game Changer Let's Dive Into the Actual workflow I'll Walk you through how it works Step by Step So you can see Why This approach is so powerful The process starts When A checkbox is checked in air table signaling That a lead is Ready For enrichment and outreach this triggers a webhook Which instantly pulls the Lead Into the workflow instead of running this Method ures we Only process qualified leads making The System more

efficient and Cost effective Once the webhook fires we move on to retrieving the leads existing data at this stage the workflow queries air table using The Record ID received from the webhook this fetes All stored CRM data for the Lead including Their website URL Their LinkedIn profiles and email by pulling in existing information first we avoid unnecessary scraping and Focus Only on enriching What is missing Now That We have the company's website URL we move on to scraping the homepage using a http

Request with the URL in hand The System sends a http Request to the homepage pulling in all Visible content along with metadata the homepage is crucial because It Often contains direct links to Key sections like the about page Products or case studies If The request succeed we have the full HTML of the homepage Ready For processing but if The request Fails whether due to server issues scraper blocks or a missing page The output will be empty to ensure We Don't break the flow we Clean up the data First Before checking If We Need A

fallback since The raw HTML is Full of clutter As I Just showed you Full of scripts Styles and other Elements we need to extract Only the readable text this code Note strips Out Everything except the core content making usable for analysis later on If Key details About The Company Services or positioning are on the homepage This Is Where we capture Them Before continuing we need to verify that the scraper returned meaningful content if the homepage Request failed or extract the text is empty this steps Flags it

instead of Letting missing data break the workflow we use this check to determine whether we continue analyzing The homepage or switch to a Different strategy the If Note is the Decision Point for this If We successfully Scrap usable text we proceed with analyzing and categorisch to Plan B scraping The LinkedIn data using this fallback ensur that even if the website blocks scrapers or lacks Key details We Still have Everything we need to personalize outreach effectively in most cases we can successfully scrape a company's

homepage extract Key business details and use that data to personalize outreach but There are always exceptions some websites Block scrapers some Go Down And some pages Simply Lack meaningful content since The homepage is our Gateway to Deeper Insights like the about Our Products page a fill scrape means we Lose a Key Data source for personalization but instead of Letting that stop the process we've built a Plan B To Make sure outreach can Still happen effectively When The homepage Can't Be Scrap we pivot to LinkedIn data instead

of Ring On on the website we SC Both The company's LinkedIn page and the Lead personal LinkedIn Profile While this doesn't Give Us as much depth as a full website scrape It Still Provides critical Insights Like The company's Mission Their size Industry Focus and the leads professional background since The website based outreach template depends on specific Company details we adjust accordingly in this case The email Still feels personalized but it's Built using LinkedIn based Insights Rather than website content ur that even

if the primary data source is unavailable outreach is still relevant effective and fully automated with the fallback strategy in Place we can Now continue with the regular Flow for cases where the homepage scrape was successful from Here wel Go Note by Note Don't blind process Every page but instead Focus on the most valuable sections this allows Us to Create a structured company overview Without redundancy While enhancing outreach personalization the first step is extracross multiple pages capturing

These ensur The System gathers a More complete picture beyond the homepage Any internal links related to about Pages product pages case studies or service explanations are identified and pulled into a list you can see on the right Side the output side you can see There are a Total of 94 items Meaning 94 urls were identified based on the homepage Once internal links are extracted they are aggregated into a structured dataset instead of passing a raw unfiltered list this step eliminate duplicates and ensur

a clean input for Ai processing by formatting aen stes relevant structur data avoiding unnecessary noise The extracted URL list Is Now analyzed by an Ai model that determines Which pages are most relevant for enrichment Rather than treating all equally the model cator Them into f sections The Company mission offerings and positioning identifies Key Products service pages process differentiation pages highlight Unique operational strategies comp advantages and Proof of success Which includes case studies

testimonials and measurable results if a relevant page Isn't Found for a section The System defaults to no relevant URL to maintain structure this step is adaptable based on Industry Needs for instance a pricing page Might be critical Sas While ecommerce business May prioritize bestsellers users can adjust this prompt to ensure Only the most relevant Company information is extracted from a website Now that the urls are categoriseren unrelated content from Being Mixed and Keeps Inside targeted for each section for each

categorization a Dedicated page exists for a section Its text is extracted if no relevant URL is Found The homepage is Scrap Again as a fallback to prevent gaps in the enrichment process this ensur that at least some data is available for Every section Once Key pages are Scrap All extracted content is merged into a structur dataset instead of handling multiple separate outputs this Step ensur The workflow maintains an organized Flow making It Easy for Ai Models to analyze Company information in

a structured format since These create pages Just Like The homepage contain HTML scripts and unnecessary formatting this code removes All nonen Elements leaving Only plain text Ai Models require structured readable inputs to work effectively So This ensur high quality data is passed forward so Before ai processing we have Another step Which prevents redundant text from Being analyzed multiple Times As I said if the prev LM was able to determine a relevant URL for a section we refer Back or we Fall Back to

scraping the homepage Again So What this code noe does is since Every LM after this has as input Both The homepage as the URL to a dedicated section we Make sure that the input Isn't exactly identical Twice using this codee if it is it filters Out One Of The Two Meaning we save half The input tokens And especially at Skill This is very important to implement then The analysis Of The Company mission This is the first Ai driven analysis step where the model extracts a structured business overview

based on available Company information instead of Simply summarize raw text The Ai filters Out irrelevant details and organizers Insights into a professional grade Company description It processes input from either an aboutus page or the homepage and extracts Branding details Company History mission statement Core values Vision Target Industry Services and achievements If certain details are not mentioned in the text The model explicit States that they are not mentioned in the text Rather than making

assumptions so The Final output is a well structured business overview formatt as Natural paragraphs Without lists or unnecessary commentary The entire process enses that Every Company is fully enriched structured And optimized For highly personalized outreach Ai driven analysis allows The workflow to adapt to Different Industries exc Only most meaningful Insights for each outreach strategy the remove duplicate notes ensur that Only Unique valuable information is processed Keeping The System efficient and

scalable the same steps are repeated for each section so we do the same Thing for the offerings and positioning section the exact Same Thing for the process and differentiation section And then finally the exact Same Thing for the analysis of Any proof and success resulting in a overview of each section so we have a very very comprehensive Insight into what the Company is About what they offer what they do and Their P History Working with other clients once again Only if it's available on the website we

don't want the llm to make stuff up or hallucinate Now that The Company insides are fully structured The Next Step is Linkedin scraping Where Decision maker details are gathered toete the personalization process With The Company data extracted we Turn to LinkedIn to fill in Any gaps and enhance outreach personalization websites Often Lack structured Insights or They Might even Block scraping but LinkedIn Provides realtime business Intelligence Company pages clearly define Industry positioning employee Count and

specializations While personal LinkedIn profiles RW career History skills and achievements allowing for targeted High impact Messaging scraping LinkedIn ures two levels of personalization At The Company level we Gain structured Inside that supplement website data And at the individual level we extract rle specific details enabling outreach that feels Natural and relevant since Linkin has a strong anti scraping protection we use apf LinkedIn Profile scraper to relia extract high quality data Without
