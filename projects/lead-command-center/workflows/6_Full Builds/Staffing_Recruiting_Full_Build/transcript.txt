Money and Today I'm pulling back the curtain to show you one of my most effective workflows Step by Step So you can copy Me and do the same this Isn't Just Another lead scraper or spambot this workflow Make sure You're Only reaching Out To leads that actually Matter The problem with scraping leads from Apollo or LinkedIn sales Navigator is that Their filters aren't perfect a lot of the data is outdated or incomplete Meaning You Could Be wasting Time on companies That aren't a Fit or reaching Out To People who don't even

clean qualify and gather additional Insights Before reaching Out to start this process I'm going to Trigger an automation That sends a webhook to NN Kicking Off The enrichment workflow Once that is done airt will automatically update the Lead status to show that the enrichment is complete now the status for all Five leads has been updated three of them were Switched to c Meaning They completely or successfully went through the entire workflow and two of them did not qualify Meaning They didn't Pass the first stage of the workflow Let

workflows and live q&a sessions Every week so If You're Serious About scaling Your b2b business with automation definitely Check It Out but alri That's Enough self promo Let's Get Into the workflow Let Me Zoom in So you guys can clearly see what is happening on screen So This workflow starts with a webhook Which receives The Record ID of the Lead we triggered in air table The Record ID we need to pull the rest of the leads details from Air table so we have All The necessary Company information Before

starting The qualification process With The Record ID received we use an Air table noe set to get to retrieve the full lead details at this Point we location The Company name LinkedIn Company URL as as Company website URL this workflow will Now validate and enrich the data to determine If The Company fits or iDEAL Customer Profile First The ife checks If The Company is based in the US since we already SC location the Lead was created we don't need to enr data we filter immediately the Lead is not in US we update The CRM

and Mark the Lead as not qualified And then delete the Lead since we Only Target Us based businesses if the Lead is in the US The workflow continues To The Next Step we filter for us leads because Our outreach strategy and offer Are optimized For Us based companies and targeting International businesses ATS complexity with lower conversion rates Now That We have confirmed that the Lead is in the US we scrape Their Company LinkedIn page we already have the LinkedIn Company URL from the Lead list

so we use that to extract raw data from the homepage this step is crucial because Apollo and LinkedIn sales Navigator Don't Always provide accurate Industry data and We Need A reliable Way To determine If The Company is actually in Staffing and recruiting in this case if it is b2b And how many employees It has exactly the LinkedIn scraper Just scrapes the Company page It Returns a MIX OF text and HTML Which is very useful Ai model to reduce input token costs for the llm In The Next Step we use a code noe to filter out the HTML

And Only Keep Clean text This is very important because lms Charge per input token so Feeding in Messi HTML wast Money removing unnecessary data also improves accuracy by giving The Ai A Clean put Now That We have a cleanup version of the LinkedIn Company page As you can see on the output side we Send it to a llm to extract three Key details first we check If The Company is actually in Staffing and recruiting second we check If The Company is b2b and lastly we want to retrieve the exact Number of employees based on the text It

Is Always in the LinkedIn text this step is crucial because raw scrape data Isn't always reliable and we need an Ai model To accurately classify whether The Company is a Fit well The determination For This one is Yes It's stuffing and recruiting Yes It's b2b and of employees is 31 As you can see Now that Ai has determined the three variables we move On To The Next Step First is checking if it's ining and recruiting w we already know the answer So This one if it is Yes it will be passed on to the through

Branch if they aren't or if they weren't ining and recruiting the CRM is updated and the Lead is Marked as not qualified as you Saw in my Air table we filter for Staffing and recruiting because This workflow Is designed and especially or Messaging is designed specifically for outbound regeneration in this niche reaching out to companies outside of this Industry Would Be A Waste Of Time because the message would not resonate with Them at all the next filter checks If The Company is b2b if they are they

move forward If not They are Marked as not qualified well we already knew From The variables extracted From The llm that they are we filter for companies to check If they're b2b because Our offer of lead Generation is meant for businesses that Sell to other businesses The Final filter Simply checks if a company has fewer than 50 employees if they do They qualify and move on to the enrichment process If They do not They are Marked as not qualified It Is Always important to tell the LM to output the

Number of employees as a number otherwise you can't check if it's Less than or greater than Whatever we avoid targeting companies bigger than 50 employees because At that size they usually have internal Team handling What I Personally offer making It A much harder Cell so by focusing on smaller teams we Target businesses that actually Need Our solution Which increases response rates CL deals faster we cleaned and qualified the Lead The Next Step is enrichment we gather Deeper Insights to personalized outreach at

this Point We verified the Lead is Us based we have checked They are in Staffing and recruiting and we ensured They are b2b and also confirmed they have fewer than 50 employees Before we move on to the enrichment process Let's Jump into instantly and take a look at theil template will be using this step is crucial because When You're building an automation like this it is much easier to determine Which variables you need Ai to generate upfront That Way You Know exactly Which data sources you need

to scrape avoiding unnecessary processing and Keeping the workflow efficient so Let Me Walk you through the email template It starts off with Hey First name followed by a personalization Within brackets this will be a personalized line I'll show You At The End of the video we help Company overview firm Le leque Method accelerator Method out you start booking meetings in weeks everything you see is Within brackets The Company overview The ICP of lead and pain lead soles will be determined by Ai and be filled in by Ai Another primary

Services firm We Just booked 27s last month of contracts Days book You At least 10 sales meetings with Decision Makers in 30 Days we work for free Until We Do would it make Sense to send over more information in regards to the structure of this email I always keep the same structure so I start off with a personalized line followed by My offer or an attention grabbing sentence followed by some social Proof or case studies Whatever followed by a guarantee Which Always helps you Seal The deal A Lot easier and then lastly a call to

Action I never or I Almost Never push directly for sales Call but Rather have Them Raise Their hand asking for some more information so I know They actually interested in what I'm offering looking at this template we can see exactly Which piece of information we need to extract Dynamic for each lead personalization As I already touched upon is a custom First Line that makes the email feel like it was Written specifically for the recipient this is one of the most important factors in Getting a response

best personalization Lines reference Unique The Company such as mission statement Is What I will be using In This workflow a recent Achievement or a Key differenti then we have Company overview This is a short Clear description of What The Company does it Should capture Their Industry Core Services and positioning in Just a sentence or A few Words actually instead of using a generic company description we extract the most relevant details LinkedIn to make it feel More Natural and especially Feel More personal then

The ICP of lead this reference To The Ideal Customer Profile that The Company serves some firms specialise in placing executives others in it professionals Healthcare workers Finance specialists you Name It understanding Their ICP allows Us to frame Our solution In A Way that Speaks directly To Their business model And To Their Needs Moving On To The Pain Point delete Soul Ise Company helps Sol Staffing firms Focus on reducing hing Time others help companies find Hard to fill roles and some Special in building long-term

Talent pipelines The More specific we can be Here The More relevant The email will Feel In The End and lastly primary Services This Is A Category that helps tor or offer a stuffing Agency that specializes in contract placements operates very differently from One focuses on Executive search or permanent hes by identifying Their primary service we can reference past case studies That are directly relevant to them since all of these variables are directly tied to What The Company does we Only Need One

data source to extract Them that data source Being The Company LinkedIn page SO instead of scraping multiple websites or Ring On various data sources keep focused andur that we minim API calls and processing we comp extract Only the most relevant information Now That We Know exactly What We Need Let's Jump Back Into n8n and Go over the part of the flow that enrich and uses Ai to extract These details Now That We have qualified the Lead in the first part of this workflow The Next Step is enrichment extra The

detailed Business Insights needed to craft a highly personalized email As I said instead of scraping multiple sources blind we Only extract From The Company LinkedIn page because It Provides Everything we need While Keeping The process efficient and mostly Cost effective an important Note Here is that we scrape The Company LinkedIn page Again Just Like we did in the qualification stage The Reason for this is that in the first step of the qualification stage we Only needed To determine whether The Company Fit or

iDEAL Customer Profile so The lms output was formed in strict json for consistency in If Noes But Now We Need A Deeper analysis and asking llm to Handle Too Many requests or Too Many tasks At Once Often results in inconsistent outputs by separating These steps we ensure each Ai function Remains precise and reliable so Let's break down exactly How This Works since we already have the Company URL we scrape it again This Time not Just To qualify The Company but to extract detailed business Insights As I

said in the qualification stage We were Simply determining If The Company was in Staffing and recruiting if it was b2b and if it had fewer than 50 employees Now We Need A Deep dive to Get rich Company data for email personalization Just Like Before scraping The Company LinkedIn page Returns a MIX OF text and HTML Which Isn't useful in its raw form to ensure that the Ai gets Clean structured data we remove all the HTML formatting Before passing It to the llm we Use the exact Same code as we did Before this helps reduce token usage

since lms Charge per input token and unnecessary HTML ads Cost It also improves accuracy by elimina noise so The Ai Only processes relevant text Now That We have the Clean text once again we Send it to an llm to generate a structured company report unlike the first llm Which Only gave Us Yes or No output Puts For filtering This one Provides a full business Profile that helps in Both email personalization and sales Call preparation The Ai extracts a structured company overview Which includes the company's full name

Industry headquarters location founding Year If available and an exact employee Count instead of a Rough Range It also Pools The Mission statement and value proposition giving Us A Clear description of What The Company stands for and the Unique value It Provides It ext details on Products Services and Technology summing The Company Key offerings including Any proprietary Technology or platforms use or Sell Thei also analyses Business operations and market present identifying primary Office locations Any notable

partnerships funding rounds Key clients certifications or Industry Awards lastly It captures the most recent Activity and Market engagement including announcements hing Activity press releases LinkedIn engagement and other signals that indicate Company growth or Expansion The detailed Company report is stored in air table so that When A sales Call is booked we already have all the relevant background information on the Lead in one Place Now That We have a full Company analysis we Send it to Another llm noe to extract Only the key

variables needed for email instead of pulling this step ures we extract Only What's relevant for outreach Keeping The Ai output focused and consistent From The Company report The Ai pulls The Company overview Which is a short structured summary of What The Company Does It also identifies The CP of the Lead Meaning the exact Type of Customer deserve whether That's A Fortune 500 Company aup a healthc firm n exs lead can solve identifying the biggest Their Cents faced framed In A Way That makes Our off highly relevant and lastly

it pulls in the primary Services Which allows Us to reference sim clients we helped in our case Study by structuring the Ai prompt as Simply as possible We keep The output Clean predictable and easy to use in our email template One Of The smaller Essential steps is Cleaning The Company Name inserting It into email When scraping Company names They Often include suffixes like llc Incorporated Limited or corp Which makes an email Feel robotic and impersonal if we would Leave Them in It Makes email look like

They were pulled Straight From A database so instead we run the Company name through noe to remove Any unnecessary suffixes ensuring that email reads smoo The Final touch to make email stand Out is a personalized opening Line This is one of the most important Parts of an email because It determines whether the recipient will Keep reading or ignore It the Ai uses Insights From The Company mission statement in this case to craft a First Line that feels Unique and Research based Once the Ai has determined all the required variables we

Store The enrich data in air table so we have a structur fully enriched record of the Lead we also Send it to instantly using an API so The email template is automatically populated with Ai generated data at this stage Our outreach sequence is fully personalized And optimized For High engagement Now that all the enriched data has been processed Let's Jump Back Into instantly and take a look at how the leads Have Been added To The campaign here you can see that three Out Of The Five leads that did qualify were added to the
