hi guys welcome back to yet another video in the previous ones I think we've covered most if not all of the basics to allow you to build whatever n10 automation you can think of for either your personal use or for your business if you're anything like me you don't just want to play around building workflows just for fun you actually want to put them to use or maybe even sell them and Implement them for other businesses in this video I'm going to show you part of the system that got me my first B2B clients a couple of months

ago for getting my first clients I used cold outbound emailing uh it's still the highest Roi sales Channel out there I won't dive too deep into the benefits of cold outbound emailing but you can either Google them yourself or you'll have to trust me on it for the day one of the most important factors when it comes to C emailing is personalization imagine you receive a very generic business email in your inbox maybe not even you're using your first name then being like hello there we can build you

a better website get in touch with us do you have time next week you would skip it I would skip it I can guarantee you you would most likely skip it yourself now imagine that same email just the opening line being something very specific something you posted yourself on your company LinkedIn page last week or maybe a month ago being like hey congratulations on your expansion to the Dutch Market we can build websites that better fit your customer needs there would be a much higher possibility of

you actually being intrigued reading that opening line uh so opening the email and maybe even replying to them being like oh wow they actually they've actually done their Research into me or they've actually done their Research into my company let's give these guys a chance the system you see on screen does exactly what I've just been talking about it scrapes their company LinkedIn profile it extracts their post achiev achievements Etc and it crafts a very highly personalized opener to an email

called email as always before I get into how you can replicate this for yourself I'll first show you a quick test run by clicking on test workflow in the bottom right we can see workflow executed successfully uh let's see what the llm came up with great work reamping 30 plus sauce websites in Just 4 years some pretty cool highly personalized stuff actually now let's dive into the nitty-gritty and let me show you how you can replicate this for yourself to get the same outcome before I get into explaining how to set this up in na10

I'll first show you where I got the lead information from which is my air table let's say you buy a large lead list on internet or maybe scrap theet yourself using a Apollo scraper or whichever software you prefer and you put it into your CRM it might look something like this so you have their first name their full name email address title or the job they have for the company the industry they're in location they operate in LinkedIn URL etc etc for the example of today I've simply copied the record ID

and put it into the air table note I'll show you how I've done that right now so back in N then we go to the air table note and as I just said I've copied the record ID over here if you're using web hooks to start your workflow which I would highly recommend by the way the record IID would be a variable instead of a static one which I'm using right now in previous videos I've shown how you how you can do this quite quick quite easily and also in next notes I'll highlight how you can just drag and drop from the

input site to fill in the necessary Fields then I simply clicked test step uh and on the right side we can see the exact same information that we just saw in our CRM we see the first name of the lead we see their company website their LinkedIn URL the location and here we see the full name next we want to retrieve their company LinkedIn profile because if businesses have anything to share or celebrate with their followers this is their platform of choice we do this by utilizing a HTTP Noe as I was

just talking about in this case we use a variable because as I just said it can be that your lead would be a variable as you're not always researching the same lead I just dragged the LinkedIn organization URL from the left side into the field because I already have the URL let's say you don't have a URL a quick Google search or a Qui quick Boolean search would get you the same result uh on the right side you can see a very big HTML file which is all the HTML it retrieved from the compy LinkedIn

profile uh and then next step we'll parse all this HTML filter it and only output the text I'll show you so next up is the code note you can pause the video and copy this code I can promise you it's going to save you a lot of time and a lot back and forth with cat GPT because I've already done that for you as input we have used the HTML from the previous note and as you can see on the right side as I just promised it has filtered all the HTML and only returned us the plain text which makes it much easier

for the next note the chat GPT note to actually digest and analyze the information and give us whatever we ask it to Output in now that we're done with the boring stuff let's get into the fun stuff which of course involves AI first first we clean the company name you might think oh why do you have to do that do you already have the company name yes of course if you got a lead list or if you scrape your leads from internet you already most likely have the company name the only thing is usually that company name includes their

LLC or Inc and real humans don't talk like that we never refer to a company as Google LLC or generic company name that's why we tell the AI to use all the input we just got from the filtered LinkedIn profile search it and reason a decent normally used company name in this case beetle beetle in the next note we ask jet gbt to extract all the posts achievements and success stories from the LinkedIn company profile I've done that by with this simple prompt I won't go over the prompt because well as I can see it is a

personal preference you can adjust this however you'd like it's pretty straightforward I would just copy and paste it if I were you and maybe make some adjustments whenever you see fit once again the input is a variable I took this input from the remove HTML return text note which was this previous code note remove everything drag it from the left paste it here and highlighted in green you can see it's correct on the right side let's go over the output quickly it returned recent posts it returned achievements and it

probably returned everything else I ask it to do I'm quite sure notable achievements as you can see here I also as you can see it mentions the timestamps time stamps are very important when talking about when crafting a relevant opener because well time is of course one of the factors that makes something actually relevant and the more relevant your opener the higher the chances are of them actually opening the email and of them replying to the email finally I use a HTTP note it's set to get but it should be set to

post post to upload the personalized opener to a email software that I use I personally use instantly but you can use whatever one you prefer it's all it all works the same and I update the record of the lead that we retrieved all the way back here with the new information of the clean company name you can add maybe all the LinkedIn profile text or maybe only the posts and of course the personalization for future reference let's say the lead doesn't respond maybe a few months down the line you'd like to

reach out again and you don't have to do the research all over again you can just look at what you've already got and send them a quick email I can promise that using this quick and easy system will get you better open rates and also much better response rates this is the exact system that got me my first clients uh so I hope it that's the same for you however if you'd still like to Outsource your sales department that's definitely possible I sell automated Sales Systems to companies to B2B companies to be

exact uh and over the past couple of months I've been generating tons of leads for my clients and they're more than satisfied I can tell you that if you're interested there's a link in the description to book a quick 10-minute Discovery call to see if I'm a fit for your company and if I can generate the same results for you lastly as I already mentioned in a earlier video that I posted on my Channel I want to shift the focus of future videos more towards the Practical side of automations because I

think they're more beneficial to you and they're also more fun to make for me going forward I will be focusing on building out automated Sales Systems on my channel so you can replicate them and get yourself your first clients or maybe build out your business it will feature s systems just like this one but also much more elaborate complicated ones and of course I'll keep you guys up to date with the latest and greatest ways to improve your own business processes if you're excited for those kinds of videos
