hello guys and welcome back to yet another video the workflow you see on screen is something I'm very excited about it was actually inspired by a comment someone left on one of my previous videos they asked if it was possible to scrape a person's LinkedIn personal LinkedIn profile and use that data to craft a highly personalized called email opener well as you can see it is possible there are some hurdles you'll need to take but I'll be going over them in this video so it's clear for everyone besides using the personal

LinkedIn profile information we're also going to be using the company profile information to craft an even better gold email opener in my opinion as I've been saying in the previous videos the most important thing when it comes to crafting called outbound email is personalization I've been going over this in previous videos but I'll be going over it indefinitely because it is the one thing that actually makes people reply to your email makes them open to listen to your offer makes them willing to have a sales call it is the only

thing that can turn any bulk email you sent from ending up in people's spam to actually ending up them having a meeting with you besides personalization the other big factor in Gold outbound email actually being successful is targeting the right people this is not something I've touched on in previous videos I don't think but in this case in this workflow you see on screen is a specific use case where I'm targeting Founders only and what do founders like to talk about find Founders like to talk about

their company and their success so this workflow does exactly that will be writing a personalized email opener which gives them a pet on the back on how good they have been able to grow their business in the amount of years since it has been founded and for me this has driven tremendous results I've been running this campaign for like a month now and it's actually looking to be one of my most sess campaigns to date before I dive in and explain this workflow let me tell you a little something about myself if you're new

here my name is Clarence I am a growth partner for B2B businesses I help them skill their business to the next level I send out hundreds of thousands of emails a month so I've been through the trials and tribulations and I know exactly what works and what doesn't if you are serious about growing your business and don't want to waste time replicating my systems and figuring out what works for you there is a link in the description below to book a discovery call as I said I can walk you through it end to end to

exactly show you how I can be of service to your business now let's dive into the workflow and see how everything's set up so here in N end you can see the workflow that I've built it is triggered by a web hook which for the purpose of this video I've deactivated because I just wanted to show you one example but you have to imagine this being triggered by a web hook then it pulls the lead from Air table which I use as my CRM but this can be anything this can be hip spot whatever you prefer whatever you're

using it's just that I'm using air table so I also won't be diving into it too much today just know that a change in the air table so me checking a checkbox which triggers the web hook then goes on to pull all the record information from the lead well in this case I've done one record ID and the lead is Scott Irwin you can see this is everything that's in my CRM something similar could be in yours depending on where you got the lead information from or where you got the lead list from then it uses a HTT P

request note simply using the LinkedIn company URL what this HTTP request note does is it retrieves all of the HTML from the company LinkedIn profile so you can see here on the right side there is a lot of code so it's quite messy but if you look closely over here for example you can see their follow account a description of the company posts are in there everything's in there well of course this isn't as legible as we wanted to be so we move on to the code note which literally says remove HTML

LinkedIn page I've named it like that here in the code note we use the input from the left side so we use all the HTML we've gotten from the company LinkedIn profile page we filter it using this code to get the output we see on the right side as you can see it is the same text that was included in the HTML but 99% of the HTML has been filtered so it's much more easy to read for the large language model which will be further down in this flow to read and analyze and actually answer the questions we wanted to answer when it

comes to the code this is the code I wrote myself with the assistance of CET CPT save yourself some time pause this video write down this code for your itself as you can see it does quite an amazing job of filtering all the dirty HTML that's on the left side on the input side and outputting I've named it plain text but outputting all of the text that is actually on the page and every that includes everything we're interested in moving on to the first large language model of this flow as you can see there are many but let me go

over them one by one so for the model I have used CET GPT 40 mini let me give you some quick context about what this large language model note actually does so as you can see on the left side and what we just talked about we have extracted all of the information that was present on the company LinkedIn profile page which was this dirty HTML along with all the text then we've filtered out the HTML to retrieve only the text and now we are asking the large language model to analyze text so analyze their company LinkedIn profile

and answer questions that we have just like I do in my previous videos I won't really be going over the prompt that I've given the large language model for too long because the questions that you'll be asking can be very specific I mean this is for the services I use it for so that's why I want to get these answers but it might be that you're looking for some complete different information so it isn't as valuable to you to copy the prompt word for word but I'll show it to you so you can copy it

so you can pause the video and copy it for yourself anyways to kind of give yourself some starting point let me give you guys some context of the structure of this llm how I prompted it well for the all encompassing one I I Ed a system prompt and it and classifies system prompts the following way usually used to set the model's Behavior or context the next user message so as you can see it's just globally me saying or telling me the role the llm has to play for the day uh and what I want it to do and then

in the next one which is a user message I describe the task and exactly what I wanted to uh be the output once again uh if you like to use this as a foundation for your own prompt pause the video and copy it for yourself something that you might notice is that the bottom of the prompt there is a piece of Json code the only thing this Json code is for is because I want the output of this llm to always be the same why do I want it to always be the same well let's say further down the line or for a instance

personalization I only want the posts to be analyzed and to be picked out the most interesting one to write a personalization about I want to be able to extract these and input them into the next note and if the name of whatever this output is is not consistent then there would be an error so let's say this time it is outputed as content and if the Json wasn't present in my prompt the next time it could be outputed as text for example but then the node doesn't recognize the input because it isn't

named in the same way so to save yourself a lot of time and a lot of headache and also save myself a lot of time a lot of headache you want the output to be in a Json so that also means you have to think this button here down on your screen and then lastly you also need to have give it some input so as I already said we used the cleaned text as input so it can read through it analyze it and output the answer to the questions we've asked which you can see on the right side interesting for today's video um is that we've asked it

to extract the exact number of employees you can see it here down the bottom why we want to do that is something I'll go over a bit later but uh this is something that I'm very proud of and it's very interesting way of personalization I haven't seen it too much but I do think and I have seen because I've been trying this out for myself that it is very much successful then onto the code note I know from previous messages I've received that people always get a bit anxious when I talk about code notes but once again

this was created with the help of my good friend ch it's a pretty straightforward one so what this one does is since the output of the previous note is Json you can see it is all segmented so this would make it very difficult for us to input everything into the next large language model for example to summarize or do whatever with it so we want to combine this all into one piece of text that is what this code is for I won't dive too deep into it because I don't think it's that interesting this was just a little back

and forth between myself and Jet GPT to come up with this code you can see on the right side it says exactly the same things so for example Mission gamber Partners believes and here Mission camber Partners believes but instead of everything being its own Standalone input it is now fused into one piece of text which once again makes it easier further down the line okay onto something that hasn't been featured too often on my YouTube channel which is using a uh API to scrape in this case someone's personal LinkedIn profile the

scraper that I used uh is available on appify I'll show you the web page in a second so here in epifi which is just a giant Marketplace for scrapers if you aren't familiar just look up LinkedIn profile scraper made by curious coder there is a free trial available but I've rented it for 25 bucks a month which isn't that expensive as you might understand here again quite a lot of code which might confuse some of you but if you go to the information tab here on the right side it'll guide you through

how to get started how to set this up and how to get everything you'll need then what you need to do is press on Json copy all of this code and paste it into the HTTP request node inside of N1 so now we're back in n then so everyone follows along then we press on this next HTTP request Noe which is set to post why is it set to post well it's set to post because we want to trigger an API we want to send like a message to the scraper to get started so the Json you just copied from the API web page you

paste it in here and then all the way at the bottom there is a URL so what you can see see here in green I'll pull it up so you can see it more clearly what you can see here in green is a expression this is based on the information we pulled from the CRM so so here on the left side one of the first notes in the workflow was to pull the leads information from the CRM well in my case the CRM I use is oh excuse me the CRM I use is air table so and because the LinkedIn profile URL is different for every lead you try to

enrich this needs to be a variable so what I've just done is I've deleted this because there will be some something here if you paste the code from the API scraper and just paste this in there and you can see on the right side what this actually says well it's the same as the LinkedIn profile URL but let's say I would be doing Tim Cook for example I would pull Tim Cook from a leads then this piece of code would also output like Tim Cook on the right side so it would actually trigger the right personal Linkin profile then you might

be wondering why there is a weight note well the thing is when you trigger a scraper the scraper might take a bit it takes a bit to run and catch all the data from the profile so that's why I have pasted a weight note there is not really another way of circumventing or getting the information from the API scraper to say it's completed so just a wait not set to 1 minute is what I found from my experience to be more than enough and it doesn't really matter because you can just trigger a lot of flows simultaneously then of course we

need to catch the data or retrieve the data excuse me from the API scraper we do this by utilizing another HTTP note set to get if you remember the last one was set to post to trigger the apfi scraper and this one is set to get to get the information from the API scraper so you have to paste this URL once again this is a variable because the data set ID that you get as a result from the successful scrape is different each and every person you scrape that's it and then you see here on the right side

Scott Irwin which is the name of the person and everything we could find on his company LinkedIn profile so a URL to his cover image to his profile image not that is of any use um his complete occupation history well everything he posted about his education in this case there are no certifications or honors he mentioned on his profile and then which you can't do any other way is get the entire about section he's written about himself which can be of use whenever you want to write a personalization about

someone because this is literally their well life story is maybe a bit much but you know what I mean which brings us on to the third code note once again if you look on the left you can see that all all the pieces of information are split so they're all stand alone very difficult for a future llm Noe to process this and actually make something meaningful meaningful from this so what I've done is written this piece of code as you can see it's really easy to get me this output which just the only thing

it does is puts everything from the left side which is separate separated into one large piece of text it contains all the information that was also here this just makes it readable for everything else that follows in this flow then of course we don't need all of the information from this LinkedIn profile we just we may have some specific questions we want to have answered that's what we use this large language model for once again set to 40 mini because I found that 40 mini is still more than capable to do things like this

and it is also very cheap because you have to bear in mind there are some costs involved when enriching a person using AI because the tokens the input tokens and the output tokens just cost you money running a flow like this might be interesting for some of you people to know is honestly like two cents so a th000 people would be $2 which is very cost effective especially if you translated it into the time it would cost you to research a thousand people and craft a personalized opener for each and every one of them once again the

prompts are split up into system and user prompts so the system prompt is more of me giving the large language model a role it needs to play and what I want it to kind of do and then here in the usern note it is the task in this specific case I ask you to give a summary of the headline and about section of his LinkedIn profile I want a career timeline and I want to identify the industry he is in here once again Json because I want the output to always be the same please if you're building a system like

this be wary of the fact that having the output always be the same or in the same structure excuse me is very important and can save you a ton of time probably figuring out how this works costed me like 10 hours so please do me a favor and save yourself those 10 hours by just asking chbt to write the output into adjacent format and pasting it in here then once at the bottom you can see the input well in this case the input was from the previous notes with turned all of the segmented data into one large

piece of text and you can see even though it it may look messy to us the CET GPD note is more than capable of figuring out what this all means and answering our questions you can see it outputed their career timeline the industry is in and it wrote me a little summary about who Scott irvan is well the lead in this case we're enriching then we want to to take both the information from the company LinkedIn profile and all the information from the personal LinkedIn profile and fuse those two together that's what happens over

here then because this is once again outputed as a Json we want to put all of the output into one large piece of text yet again because that just makes it a lot easier for the large language model this one the summarized input one to read so as you can see again on the left side everything is stand alone and we want it to be one large piece of text this is actually the exact same code as I used in the uh second code note over here so if you pause the video copy the code you can just paste it in here don't

worry you don't have to redo everything again and you can see it's plain text everything it was on the left side is now on the right side but instead of it all being segmented it is fused into one and then for the second to last code note what we want to do what we want to achieve is to um fuse the information from the company LinkedIn profile together with the personal LinkedIn profile once again into one large piece of text so for the final cat GPT note we're going to be using uh is to summarize both the company LinkedIn

profile and the personal LinkedIn profile and extracting the most interesting and relevant information which can vary depending on the lead you're enriching because some people post post very little on their personal LinkedIn profile Some people post very little on their company LinkedIn profile so there can be disc that's why we have to do it this way uh fusing these two texts together is what we do over here and is this code as you can see it just takes the input from well I haven't named it properly but you understand it

if you look at the workflow fuse input into one item three which is just a duplicate and fuse input into it one item one and it just combines text of those two two inputs as you can see combined text so here they are separately Source One and Source two and a combined text is if you scroll down just everything together so I already talked about it briefly but then we have this summarize input which is the large D note of this flow what this does is summarize the company LinkedIn profile information and just give me a brief

summary as you can see on the right side there are some basic stuff that you might want to use in future sequences of your C Outreach so let's say I want identify their industry their mission and values product and service summarized etc etc um something notable here is specific achievement because I've prompted it to derive a specific achievement the compan has had based on like posts on the company LinkedIn profile this is something that I would advise you using for crafting personalized Emil openers it's something

that I've used in the past with great success but this video is more about showcasing other ways of using personalization in email openers and as you can see all of the output is once again in Json format because you might want to use this or upload this to your CRM to your email provider separately to paste it in as variables inside of email templates so for the third time we fuse the Json from the input into one piece of text to make it easier for potential future llms this is just the use case of

using the code note which then brings us on to the final large language model note you might be surprised to note that I'm using CLA to actually write the gold emo openers instead of jet GPT from my experience and I mean it's an ongoing process because both companies keep building out their AI capabilities for now from my experience Claud is better at copywriting than CPT and CET GPT is better at analyzing data better than cloth so let me dive into this node and show you what I've done to get the output so first of all

the input is the fuse together text from the company uh business profile and the LinkedIn personal profile which we've covered a few notes ago so it has all the information about when the company was founded how many employees it has now uh the industry that is in etc etc and then we only use one prompt which is a system prompt I'll show it to you right now what I do is I give it very clear rules so I want to use fifth grade language of course most if not all business Founders are more than capable

of understanding language from higher grades than fifth grade but it's just like kind of a rule of thumb to keep your language simple so it's easy for people to read they don't have to read it twice it just makes well reading the email a lot more pleasant I give it like the tone of the message in and tell it to use congrats instead of congratulations which is a big thing because well congratulations always sound so formal and a bit robotic and I tell it to use a 30w maximum and the compliment should only be focused on the

business this is something you can tweak for yourself I mean it could also be that you want the uh compliment to be more focused on the person how they have grown the company or whatever whichever use case you use this workflow for and then I've given the model some examples giving the examples of the output just saves you a lot of time because you can prompt it whatever way you want the llm will just run with it and sometimes it's like banging your head into a wall because it just doesn't give you the

output you want unless you give it some example so I've given it some examples now let me show you the output it came up with so the company of the person we've enriched is called gamber Partners well we've already seen before right here that it has 15 employees which you can see right here which is what we extracted from the company LinkedIn profile which I went over quite a long time ago now because this video has been going on for long enough then we can also see when the company was founded so how long ago April 22 and

that's all being used here you can see the 15 person and the 2020 into the C email opener so let me read it for you seeing how camera Partners has grown into a 15% team since launching in 2020 or making such an impact in software investing is really inspiring because software investing is also a variable we have enriched from both his LinkedIn Pro personal profile and his company profile I can press on test step so I can show you a different outcome so here you can see it came up with something else

congrats on gamer Partners growth in software investing since 2020 building a 15 person team while focusing on product lab growth companies is truly impressive as I said the purpose of this workflow is to craft a highly personalized complement a towards a founder of a company because we're only targeting founders with my lead list I'm only targeting Founders because they're decision makers and they're usually the easiest people to convince they are in need of growth which is exactly what I can provide and I think this does the

job I've seen from results from the marketing campaign the Outreach called Outreach campaign I've been running for over a month now using the system to craft me openers that it has been really successful people just like the output so to wrap things up I just want to emphasize one once again that there are two things which are most important when it comes to cold Outreach one is a targeting but the targeting can be very simple because it's just thinking about who might be the decision maker in charge of okaying either going ahead

with your product or your surface which in the use case I just shown you is f for me was Founders and besides that it's personalization you can get data from a lot of places I think LinkedIn is the most valuable source because people post a lot of stuff either on their personal profile or especially on their company profile um and since you want business about their company that's where you can get it if you're thinking about getting started with C Outreach please do not send generic bul emails to

each and every one of them Implement one of these systems if you don't have the time and if you want to save yourself some time click the link in the description below I can build these systems for you and I can actually help you scale and turn cold Outreach into the most consistent influx of new um then All That Remains is to thank you guys for watching if you found this helpful if you've learned anything please hit a like don't forget to subscribe for future videos about gold email Automation and lead generation and

I hope to see you guys on the next one bye
