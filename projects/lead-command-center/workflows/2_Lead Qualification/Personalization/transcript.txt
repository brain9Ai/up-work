hello guys welcome back to another video in the last video I showed how you can use automation to generate highly targeted lead lists and get emails and phone numbers of potential clients this is the follow-up uh I'll be showing you the exact automation that I used to generate me my first clients for those who don't know my name is Clarence I build and Implement automated Sales Systems for B2B businesses over the past year I've consistently added over 100,000 in sales pipeline per month to dozens of B2B businesses if you're

interested in Outsourcing your sales and skill your business there's a link in the description below uh I'm looking forward to connect now that is out of the way let's get back to the automation which leverages uh AI to enrich a lead and write a highly personalized email opener every time I tell someone about the business I'm in which is using gold email for lead generation people always ask me if email still works my answer to that is quite simple because statistically speaking email marketing

is still 40 times more effective than social media marketing it's also very scalable using Ai and automation that is it should be noted that the one thing that makes email work is personalization and the more personalization you have in the email the better it works and the better it converts sending a bulk email to a thousand people might get you a few responses but most if not all of them will be to kindly remove them from your subscriber list personalization solves this problem gets you a lot of responses

a lot of bookings and people actually feel like you've done your research and they're more willing to do business with you the thing is that researching each and every lead and writing a personalized email to every one of them used to take way too much time luckily for you and luckily for me we live in the age of AI and automation which makes this a lot easier let's dive into the automation here on screen since that's why you clicked on this video and I'll go over each note step by step so everything is clear for everyone before

I go over each note step by step I want to get two things out of the way as you can see here I use a web hook to trigger this workflow the web Hook is deactivated because I'm going to show you guys one specific example this web hook to put it simply is just a trigger from another website or some other software which sends something to this web hook to get this started and usually contains some information uh in this case for this workflow it would contain the information of the record ID which it then needs to get from the air table

I'll get into that into a second first let me go over why I'm using two if noes for those who have been looking at our screen quite closely the reason being is that if you scrape leads from Apollo and even though your filters are very strict let's say you're only filtering for businesses inside of the US which I am doing there might also sometimes be some businesses which which aren't based in the US which are based in India the UK France whatever that's why I've implemented this extra step when

retrieving all the information from Apollo I also retrieve the company's HQ location if that's not in the US then this simply goes down the false and it updates my aor table stating the business not in the US don't pursue this lead same goes for this check this checks if it's a B2B or a b2c business I'm in the lead generation Services business for B2B companies so sending a email to BTC companies offering offering my services uh is of no use it'll most likely just get me put into a spam folder which will hurt the reputation of

my email account and also hurt my deliverability in the long run now that has been covered let me dive into each note step by step and let me show you how this magic actually works so first off I'm pulling a lead from the air table so I'm simply pulling a lead from a list of leads so usually on the input side there's some information because this is on the left side there's a web hook which then would have received not only trigger but also the record ID information so you would input This Record ID information as a variable here

so this is the Json code for that json. query. record ID but as I already said because I'm just using one example I copy and pasted the specific record ID of this person Matt met penfold all the information you see over here on the output side is just information that is scraped from Apollo uh so I've done not done any research this is just simply simply an Apollo scraper if you haven't done it and you want more information on how to get all this information like their LinkedIn uh URL their company

website etc etc email address just go watch my previous video then a bit further down the line you might notice a weight note some might be thinking why do you use a weight note that's because let's say I bul trigger workflows from Air table so I want a lot of leads to be enriched at the same time this sometimes caused my HTTP request Noe to give me a timeout error saying there are too many requests at the same time so I simply added a wait note which Waits 3 seconds between each and every one of them to

give this one some more time and not make it give me an error the LinkedIn company scraper all it does is literally get the LinkedIn organization URL from the left side it goes to the website and retrieves all of the HTML from that page as you can see there's a lot of unnecessary stuff and as always we only want to retrieve the text so that's why I use this code note you see this code note all over the place in this case remove HTML and in this case remove HTML it is used to remove the HTML from the retrieve web

page it got and the other ones I will go over in a second so this is code I wrote with the assistance of jet GPT for those who don't know I have some experience with code and I can get myself somewhere but I don't know everything H so luckily for me I can call upon CET GPT whenever it's needed uh as you might remember from the last note and also here on the input side there is a lot of HTML which was retrieved from the web page um that's why I use this code this code simply filters all the HTML and only

returns me the play text as you can see on the right side all you can see is plain text no code anywhere perfect filter you can to save yourself a lot of time just pause this video I'll go show you the code very slowly just put it on a notepad somewhere and paste it in for yourself continuing on maybe give you some oversight so in this HTTP request note we retrieved all the HTML from the company LinkedIn profile the company LinkedIn profile contains a lot of information about the number of employees the companies has an about

section Sometimes some recent post the company posted on there depending on the size of the company and how involved they are in the modern world World in this cat GPT note I simply ask it to summarize and find the most relevant posts from the company LinkedIn profile I won't read out all of the prompts so same as you did for the code note please just pause your video and write this some down somewhere because it's a lot to go over and it's also very specific on the Services you're offer offering because I

want to know some different information and some different insights to Target my specific offer to them uh and you depending on the service you offer might have something completely different in mind uh one thing to note is that I output all of this content as a Json and I also tell it here in the prompt how I want it to Output each and every time that's because later down in this workflow I'm going to use some of the these sections and I want want them to always be outputed in the same way otherwise you might get some errors here

and there just take note of that then for the second code note this is once again quite a simple code even though it might look confusing to the untrained eye if I were you I would just pause the video and copy this for yourself what this does is put all of the Json which you can see on the left side are all individual pieces of information and it turns it into one piece of text which is once again a lot easier well it's the only kind of feasible way the AI the CET GPT note which I'm using further down

this workflow to kind of read through this all so the same as for the remove HTML code note I also have three of these fuse input that is because at several points in the workflow I want the output of the llm in this case the ch PT Noe to be outputed as a Json because there might be some specific parts of that output that I want to use as input in something else and to use it as input consistently it needs to be the same code each and every time and for it to be the same code each and every time

it's best to Output it as a Json otherwise it's a lot of uh prompting and those prompts might not always be as detailed or as specific or as effective as you want them to be so save yourself some time output the CET GPT um response as a Json if you need it further down the line and then simply use a code note to then uh fuse it back together in one piece of text so I already went over the if note so I'll skip over that for now which brings us onto the get company website which is once again simply a

HTTP request Noe put to get um this is quite quite a bit of code this is simply because this is an if it's available use this if not use the other so you can copy this but you can also save yourself some time because nine out of 10 times the lead information scraped from Apollo includes the company website so you could also just put this company website and paste it here as a variable to get the HTML from their company website which in this case is everything you see on the output side once again you see

some text like over here but you see a lot of unnecessary HTML HTML which is also hard to read for the large language model so we are filtering this once again using this code note with the exact same code as we have before so if you pause it and copi this it'll look exactly the same as this and on the right side we can once again see it has filtered 9 9% of the HTML and just only the plain text remains for the second large language model note I ask it to analyze the data from the company website once again I won't read through

the entire prompt because I think it's a waste of time since it's quite specific but you can copy this for yourself uh and make some adjustments where needed here I ask it to retrieve product and do product and service analysis I ask it to look for the key messaging andil proposition of the surface of the business and I ask it to do content analysis so if there are any success stories or whatever it'll let me know and then on the right side you would get the output for the person who's paying attention this is not being outputed as

a Json this is already one piece of text because I'm not using any of these outcomes specifically in other notes so you might be wondering oh if you're not outputting this as a Json why is this a fuse input Noe right after it that's because I want these two texts to summarize the relev relevancy of the LinkedIn company profile and the analytics of the company website to be fused into one piece of text Al together as you can see Source One is company website and Source two which is why it looks a bit strange is the fuse together

Json from the company LinkedIn business profile and then the combined text is everything exactly everything bit of a different code even easier code once again mostly written by Chad GPT understand understood by me uh paste it in here test it a few times and then it works then this is quite a strange note to some of you because you might say I already pulled the company name from Apollo yes you did but sometimes that company names includes Inc or include some texts which you would never use uh writing an email to someone because

let's say you're emailing someone at Tesla and it would have been a startup but let's use Tesla for an example and you would say hey great growth or amazing seeing your growth with Tesla Inc nobody uses Tesla Inc when talking to someone who works at Tesla you just talk about Tesla so you want to erase that ink part or erase whatever they have put as their company business name and clean it so to say in this case there was nothing strange about it the company is called first Inc it was already called first so all that's

remaining is first it's a very well it's interesting because I use 01 mini for this the reasoning model and it's very short prompt because it's a very easy task as you can see sometimes the name might include LLC ink or limited if you're talking about UK companies and you just want to filter that and keep a clean company name so you can address them in your business email your C email which brings me on to the summarize input note what this does or what the input actually is is the analyze content from the from the

LinkedIn company profile and from The Business website here you have the prompts and here is the more specific prompt I ask it to do several things Define the company's industry summarize the main mission or values describe the main product summarize that main product highlight the company's main USB identify the type of company and identify their target audience and the ICP ideal client profile and output it exactly like this so it's also outputed as a Json you can see and you can also see it on the right so for first this is

the output it's a clean technology and energy management etc etc but where it's interesting is you've retrieved quite some information some recent post from the LinkedIn business profile but also maybe some post or some text on the website which highlighted a specific achievement and this note picks out and one of them the one it finds most notable excited to work with Arcadia to solve problems for large corporate energy users so this is most likely a business partner partnership I filtered it to make this a

recent achievement so this is probably within the last N9 months which we can then later on use in this one because I'm skipping over the code note for now as I on a tangent but in this one we use specifically that the excited to work with Arcadia to solve problems for large language large corporate energy users to create a personalization so the opening line of the gold email would be impressed by your partnership or the KD taking or major ener challenge for our customers let's say you are the founder

or CEO of First the company we are targeting which we pulled from the air table and you would read this personalization one I just read over impressed by partnership with Arcadia taking on major energy and challenges for large customers it's something highly specific the least you would think is that I would have scrolled either through your website or through your company LinkedIn profile and I took some time to research a company which which I didn't this is literally this entire workflow is triggered by a press

on a button or to be specific taking a check boox in air table and it outputs all this information saving you a lot of time and also meaning you can do this in bul depending on how many email accounts you have you can do this to you can send a 100 of these emails a day after you've generated a personalization which is usually just the opening line or the second line of a called email we simply update the air table with all the information we received we use the ID to match so this is the same exact same

record ID we use to pull lead from Air table in that note we upload the clean company name so it's there for future reference we uh upload all the information we got from their LinkedIn company profile same from their Business website we also upload the summary um but let's say you want more information or the summary isn't clear which might sometimes be the case you can just look back at more uh elaborate information we upload the personalization uh in this case I also upload the time which is

just simple uh we upload what type of company it is and we upload their product and service so in just a quick overview in your CRM you exactly know what this company is about let's say they schedule a meeting and you need to do some research we do the same in the note below this is a HTTP request note sent to post method post actually this is simply a instantly API which instantly is my cold email software it's the cold email software that I use and that I recommend because it's very easy to use and also very easy to set up and

I simply sent all the information so I sent email address first name but also it's personalization that we generated and once again type company product and services in future videos I will show you how I set up my instantly and how you can copy that exactly but for this case it's not really necessary good thing to note this can be an API upload to whatever you use you can also do it manually because but on this on this channel we try to automate as much as possible but let's say you Lo use Smart

lead or something else to send emails you can just it can be whatever that's all I'm trying to say well that just rests me to say if you've watched all the way through the end of this video I want to thank you for watching please consider leaving a like and subscribing um videos like this will be more common in the future this is the exact example I use to get my first clients uh a few months ago so I'm sure it'll help somebody out there if you have any questions you can leave them down in the comments below once again if you're re

interested in Outsourcing your sales as a B2B business please look at the description below there is a link to a discovery call to a g.com uh link to get in touch with me uh and I can see or we can exp we can discuss how I can be of service to your business and help you skill massively like I've done for others that is it for today I'll see you guys in the near future I promise uh thank you for watching and bye
