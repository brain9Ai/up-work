you are putting in work sending gold emails booking meetings trying to get clients but there's just one problem your lead list is full of people who will never buy from you does that sound familiar maybe you pulled a lead list from Apollo scraped LinkedIn or used some other tool that promised you targeted leads but now you're just stuck sorting through a mix of businesses that don't fit your offer at all some are too small to afford your services others are way too big and already have an in-house

team and then there are the ones who aren't even in your Market if you're not careful you end up wasting time money and effort chasing the wrong leads what if you could automatically qualify every lead on your list before you ever send a single email what if you could instantly filter out the ones that aren't the fit and only focus on the prospects that actually match your ideal customer profile here's a quick look at some of my C email results these campaigns aren't just blasting messages to random

businesses I'm reaching out to the right people with the right messaging because I've already done the hard work of qualifying Ing and segmenting my leads this right here is the power of segmentation because I've pre-qualified my leads checking if they're US based B2B and the right company size I can craft messaging that speaks directly to their needs so no more generic Outreach no more wasted emails instead of wasting time on the wrong leads I get higher response rates better conversions and most importantly more booked meetings in

this video I'm going to show you exactly how to do the same using Ai and automation inside of of n8n I'll walk you through how I personally set up lead qualification so you can spend less time guessing and more time booking meetings with the right people now let's talk about why this is such a big deal most lead lists are a complete mixed bag even if you think you've pulled a solid list from Apollo or LinkedIn chances are it's filled with a combination of relevant and completely irrelevant prospects

you've got businesses that don't fit your criteria companies that are too small to afford your service and massive corporations that already have in-house teams handling exactly what you do because here's the kicker those filters inside lead databases they're not always as accurate as you think just because a tool says a company is B2B doesn't mean it actually is just because it shows a certain company size doesn't mean it's correct that means you still have to manually check verify and clean up your

list before reaching out and let's be honest that is a complete waste of your time this is also the point where most people burn through their time and burn through their resources if you're sending hundreds or even thousands of gold emails to the wrong people your response rate suffer your domain reputation tanks and worst of all you're not getting clients that is why segmentation and qualification is so important because when you properly qualify and categorize leads you're not just reaching out to random businesses

you're crafting highly specific messages that speak directly to the right people and that is what makes the difference between getting ignored and actually booking meetings so how how do you fix this how do you stop wasting time on bad leads and start focusing only on businesses that actually need what you offer well if you're new here my name is Clarence I run an automated leaden agency that helps businesses skill at lightning speed and here's the thing my job isn't just about sending emails it's

about making sure my clients get qualified leads who actually book meetings because if I'm reaching out to the wrong people Nothing Else Matters that is why filtering and segmenting leads is a non-negotiable in my process if you're serious about taking your Outreach to the next level I've got a school Community where I break down these automations in even more detail you can download my workflows see step-by-step breakdowns and learn the fastest way to get clients using Ai and automation the link is in the

description if you want to check it out but let's get into today's issue automatically qualifying your lead so you only focus on the right prospects instead of manually sorting through lists and second guessing every contact I'm going to show you how to set up an automated qualification system using n8n this will filter out bad leads instantly and segment the ones that actually fit your ICP so you can personalize your messaging and increase your chances of getting a response let's stop wasting time and dive into the workflow okay so

looking at this workflow from left to right you can see that the entire flow is being triggered by a web hook for those not familiar with web hooks what a web Hook is it's simply a message or a trigger which is sent out by a different application in this case the other application is air table so if I make a change in air table there's an automation which sends a web hook that is then received by this web hook and starts running the flow once the webbook is received we continue on to the air table note which I use to pull all of

the information that I have from my lead up to this point from inside of my CRM I use a table as my CRM and get all the information in this flow so I can work with it manipulate it do whatever just to give you guys some context I will quickly jump into my Air table to show you how I've set up my lead list what information already available from scraping Apollo in this case and how I sent a web Hook from Air table to my end at end workflow to start the process so here in air table I have an example lead

list one of my lead lists it's a list containing a thousand leads as you can see in the bottom left they're all yet to be enriched that is their status meaning the only information I have is what I scraped from Apollo you can see I have their name their email address their location we can immediately spot a fault in one of these because I only work with us-based companies and you can see that this company btech is based out of China meaning this should be filtered from my dead list and there will

probably be a lot more I can see Berlin over here so it's obvious from even at first glance that this lead list needs some cleaning up and that's exactly what we're going to be doing with the flow that I've set up and I'll walk you guys through it but how do I start that flow from inside of my CRM from inside of air table so my air table automation is triggered so you it sends a web hook to NN when the status of my lead is lead yet to be enriched and I check this box then it starts running the float start

running inside of n because this lead operates out of China you can see it updated its status to Lost meaning it didn't qualify it didn't pass the test and it was removed kind of from my lead list okay back in NN let me kind of walk you through it so what I just showed you is that when I scraped a lead list from Apollo I also scraped their location so we already had the location without doing any further due diligence or any further enrichment so when the lead was pulled from the a table I had all

information including their location so I could immediately set up an if note which simply checks if the location matches the United States if it is a match it would be sent through to the through Branch if it isn't a match so if it's anything else in United States it would update my CRM as you could just see and it would update the status of the lead to Lost which you can see down here setting up the air table notes is very straightforward because they have an integration with air table so it's just setting up

your credentials finding the right base and linking the right table I'll show you a few test runs later on in this video but I first will quickly walk you through what the flow does and why I've set it up like this before diving into specifics and mentioning why I set it up in the way that I did set it up besides the us yes or no so to check if the company is based in the US yes or no there are two more if notes one is to check if the company or the business is a B2B business or a b2c business because

I am personally in lead generation for B2B businesses it would make no sense to reach out to BTC businesses and they would immediately either respond with please unsubscribe me from this list or they would put me in spam which would hurt my sending reputation besides the fact that it would be a waste of my input tokens into other large language models which I would have used to enrich the lead and send them an email through instantly which is the email provider I always use so as I already mentioned and

as you already could see if the location of the lead inside of my CRM does not match the US it is sent through to the false Branch it is outputed as false and the status of the lead is updated you can delete the lead whatever you want to do but I'd like to keep them there so I can check for duplicates in the future so I don't have to run them through workflows over and over and over again if I scrape another lead list and the name is in there as well if the lead is based in US it goes to the through

Branch because we want to do some further due diligence to do some further qualifying how do we do this what we do this by fetching the HTML from the company's LinkedIn page I'll quickly go back to the lead list and I can show you over here that we have their company LinkedIn URL so it's very easy for us I'll show you some examples later on this video but I first want to give you guys a quick run through so you have a very clear understand understanding of what's going to happen before I dive into specifics so what happens in this

HTP node is we fetch all of the HTML that's on the page of the company LinkedIn so we get their about section we get the number of employees we get all the details that they've put on there then we use this code note to filter out that HTML code which only leaves us with the plain text which makes it easier for us to read makes it easier for the large to read and saves us a lot of input tokens even though large language models are getting cheaper and cheaper it's still always a good thing to be costc conscious

especially if you do this in bu there are days where I enrich well over 10,000 leads so you can calculate the costs and it hurts the bottom line at some point especially if it's a waste of input tokens and a waste of time that's also why I implemented this qualification not only for myself but also for all of the clients I work with so the text that remained from the LinkedIn company page which includes everything even recent posts is put into a chat GPT note let me show you guys a prompt because here it

gets kind of interesting so first I just gave it a task so I'm describing what it is you're a you're an expert in professional business analysis guys get the point and I wanted to analyze strap LinkedIn profile of a company to produce a high quality detailed report then below there's a much more elaborate prompt here I've written out everything I wanted to identify from the output so from the LinkedIn company page so I want some company insights a summary of their mission and vision I want to identify

mentions of recent growth because uh if you scrape everything from their company LinkedIn page you also get their most recent post so if they've mentioned anything about opening a new office or whatever hiring new people you want that information because it may be useful down the line if you're ever planning on writing a personalized email I want to know their business model because I want know if they're B2B or BTC jet GPT is very good at business analytics so from a small about section they can easily

identify if it's btb or BTC I would say it's 99.9% accuracy and then lastly very important for us because we don't want to reach out to businesses who don't have a budget and we don't want to reach out to corporations who are too big to offer our services to we want to know the exact number of employees because that gives us a very good indication of where the business is in terms of growth and size which in turn gives us quite a good ID of if there is any budget to hire us or if they're too big for us to be a good fit

even though I Tiner with prompting each and every day I still don't always get the output I want so here I have some notes which have proven to be a necessity to give me a consistent output which I can use over and over again without having to go in and fix errors each and every day and then if I scroll down you might see this this is the Json why is there some Json that is because I will be needing certain things to be outputed the exact same way each and every time so I'm going to be needing the business model as we an output and

the number of employees as an output so I have to tell the large language model or CH GPT in this case exactly how it needs to Output it otherwise if I test run this it might output business model the next time I test run it it might say business type whatever it might just give you variations of the output you need the other nodes which need very specific parameters to be able to check and verify stuff don't work because they don't recognize the input if that makes sense but I'll get into depth a bit

further down the line and I'll show you what I mean and why this is so important just note that this seems a lot more difficult or looks a lot more difficult than it is you can actually just based on this you can copy and paste this into cat GPT and ask it to give you a Json output template and it would produce you something similar to this doesn't have to be the exact same as long as the output is consistent it'll work and then lastly because it does extract recent posts I want you to know today's date

because I'm asking the large language model to rank the reason post based on relevancy and time plays a very big factor in deciding relevancy at least I do think so so when the jet gbt node large language one note whatever you want to call it has identified the business model so if it's B2B or b2c we move over to the if note if the output which is going to be exactly this does not match BTC it will output it to the through Branch if it does match BTC it will be put to the false branch and once again the status of the lead will be

updated in air table to lost and it would say b2c for example giving me a very clear understanding of why this lead does not need any further enrichment and I don't need to reach out to them if it passed that test we move on to the headcount one which I simply use to check if the company size of the exact number of employees is smaller than 20 and larger than five because through trial and error I kind of figured out for myself and for the service that I offer that if the business is between six and 19 employees

that is kind of the perfect time to step in and offer my services because it usually means there is some budget and they're looking to scale up which I can help them with so if the company would be smaller than five or larger than 20 once again the air table would be updated losing the lead deleting the lead whatever it would just give me an indication that it it's not necessary to reach out to them or enrich them any further so let's say your lead qualifies it is in us they are a B2B and they're

in my case between six and 19 people you would attach this part this snippet of a workflow to a larger enrichment part of the flow which would look something like this this is one of the ones that I do use so what would happen then you would scrape their company website because next to the URL to their company LinkedIn page you also have the URL to their company website or you do anyways because you have their email and everything after the ad is their domain so even if you don't have the company

website from the lead scrape you can always use an expression inside of n8n to get their email and split it to only use h htps Dash L part of their email which is their domain to their website 9 and 10 times so the same as you would do for the company LinkedIn you would scrape all of the HTML which would return you all of the text that is present on the homepage you would filter at HTML you would then analyze everything I mean maybe there are testimonials maybe there are case studies probably they're

talking about their unique selling point so you might have an understanding of their and you have a better understanding of their business which can all be used to either fill in variables in a template an email template that you wrote in advance or it can be used to write a very highly personalized email opener which massively improves your reply rates and especially positive reply rates you would then clean their company name because inside of the a table you may have noticed that some companies are

called XYZ inc.com or xyc LC you name it you of course don't want to mention that LLC or that ink part inside of the email because it looks very robotic no human rights like that because you don't talk like that then you could summarize the information from their LinkedIn and the information from their company website in here to get a very comprehensive picture of your lead let's say you move it on to your sales team for example they'll have to do a call they would simply have to read a small summary

about the person to get all the information they need to be handling the sales call moving on to writing a personalized line writing a personalized line to open an email with is very important it has been I mean I've been using it from the beginning but I've also tested not using a personalized line and immediately jumping into either my offer or the desired outcome I can offer my clients and there is such a big distinction between doing your due diligence due diligence or letting AI do the due diligence would make it look

like you've done your research and sending something relevant to them as I mentioned earlier like a recent post or a testimonial from their website things like like that just a quick compliment suffices but you can let AI write it probably better than I I ever could and then you would upload the personalized line and all of the information into your a table and you would also upload it to instantly so you can automatically without having to do anything yourself send out C emails to all of the leads

you have qualified and enriched okay that was all of the theory for today now let me quickly jump back into air table and Rich a few Le show you some of the ones that didn't pass the qualification test so you guys have a better understanding of how it works and you actually see it inter action and I can also maybe elaborate a bit more on how I set up these notes and you guys can actually see the input and output of everything so here inside of air table once again I handpicked three leads which I knew wouldn't pass

qualifications one of them is based out of China it isn't in us so it doesn't qualify for that one one is a b2c and one of them is a company with a headcount bigger than 20 so I'll show you the executions inside of n81 so don't pay attention to any of the errors I did some testing but I'll run you through each one of them one of them was from China so it didn't match us so it updated not in the US one of them was a b2c so it didn't pass this if note meaning it was updated to the a table as not B2B and then lastly one of them

didn't pass the head count one meaning it was because it was too big so it updated my air table saying it was too big too small doesn't really matter they didn't pass the qualification I'll dive into this one to show you what the web hook does and what all of these notes do when they actually process some information so firstly of course the web hook what does a web hook do as I said the web Hook was triggered by a change inside of my a table so I checked the box and the status of the lead was yet

to be enriched so it's started the enrichment process before it starts the qualification process so what did the web hook sent the only thing the web hook sent was the record ID that is why we need to follow up the web hook with a air table note the task of this air table note is to fetch us all of the other information that is corresponding with this record ID you can see that the record ID matches what you see here on the left what you do to set this up for those who aren't familiar with NN you

would just drag this from the left and place it here put it in expression and it would work every time it would be a variable so no matter which lead you would try to enrich because each each of them has their specific record ID it would just work with each and every one of them without you having to manually input anything so this was the third lead in my aor table which had the company which was too big as you can see the status was yet to be enriched so that's why it worked and the automation

worked then we were checking if the location matched the us we already know it does but let me check on the left yeah here you can see the location was already inside of my CRM Rally North Carolina United States so location matches United States because it's in there same setup you would just drag this from the left place it there then on to something a bit more interesting but also very easy to set up which is the HTP note on the left once again and already showed you inside of my a table but we have their LinkedIn organization

URL which is the URL to their LinkedIn company page so what we do is set the method to get baste in their URL or drag it from the left in here once again it's a variable the URL is different for every lead and then it just fetches us all of the HTML that is present on that page which you see on the right side which is the output side a lot of this is code you can see some relevant text which we actually want to keep how do we filter out the code and keep this we use a code note by now since I've

been doing this for a while have gotten a bit more familiar with code but when I started like six months ago I was also not familiar with code and something like this wouldn't scare me but it would uh make me question myself I generated all this code with the help of cat GPT so you can do the same at home what this code does just to quickly give you guys an IDE it goes through the content it analyzes it and it filters it out so all you're left with is the plain text as you can see on the right side which is

exactly the same as you would find on their company LinkedIn page including their number of employees uh an about section of their company when they were founded what they're about what they do so the AI has enough information to determine if it's a B2B or a b2c and you can already see here that there are some recent posts so all with all a very amazing very quick way to get a lot of insights into a company without without having to lift the finger yourself so I already walked you guys through uh The

Prompt of the llm node but I'll dive into it and show you the output so if you remember I asked it to give me some company insights I asked it to retrieve me the recent posts and updates as it did with the timestamps once again because I think time plays a very big factor in relevancy or when it comes to relevancy I asked it to determine business model based on the output from the previous note which was just text on company LinkedIn page and I asked it to Output the exact number of employees it

is important that this is outputed as a number I mean these are numbers but there's a distinction between something being outputed as a string or something being outputed as a number and if it would be a string which you can see would be an a then the if node wouldn't be able to process it or it wouldn't work or it wouldn't know how to read it it and say if it's larger or smaller than a specific number but I'll show you in a second so from the LinkedIn organization page the large language model was able to determine if it

matches a B2B or a b2c what this codeing green translates to is it translates to B2B to the output B2B of course is not equal to b2c so it's forwarded to the true branch in that false Branch meaning we continue on to next qualification which was the head count as I just mentioned it is very important for the number to be outputed as a number as you can see by the hashtag because we need that to kind of qualify if the number is larger or smaller than x so once again what's in green it's a variable because

for every lead number of employees is going to be different or well there's a very high chance it's going to be different and I just pulled this from the left place it in here this translate to 26 and this translates to 26 26 is higher than 20 also higher than five because it's higher than 20 already it doesn't match and it's outputed to false Branch meaning all three of these leads that I showed as handpicked examples didn't qualify and are not worth pursuing for my B2B lead generation business mainly focusing companies in us

okay that about sums up how you can automatically qualify and segment your lead list so you only reach out to to the right prospects no more wasting time on leads that will never convert just highly targeted Outreach to businesses that actually need what you offer or are likely to be needing what you offer to quickly break it down this workflow filters leads based on three key factors first being is the company based in us that's because I primarily work with businesses in the US and this helps me

avoid Outreach to companies that wouldn't be a fit due to language barriers or other restrictions secondly is the compy B2B or b2c because I am in the B2B lead generation business I only work with B2B clients because my service just doesn't apply to BTC companies and thirdly what is their company size if the company is too small they likely don't have the budget and if it's too big they probably already have an in-house sales team handling lead generation this way I'm not just reaching out to random businesses I'm

reaching out to decision makers at companies that actually need my services and that is what makes all the difference and gives me quite amazing results from my email campaigns when you take the time to properly categorize your leads your messaging becomes way more specific and relevant that is what separates a gold email that gets ignored from one that actually Sparks interest and leads to booked calls so if this was helpful make sure to like And subscribe because this is just a small part of much more advanced automations I break
