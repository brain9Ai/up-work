# Ultimate Guide: "Keywords ➜ Decision‑Makers" Lead‑Gen Workflow

*Built from the supplied JSON workflow and verbatim transcript*

## 1 | What the System Does

**Goal**: Autonomously turn a keyword + location into CRM‑ready contacts whose work‑emails are already verified, so reps only talk to pre‑qualified buyers.

Two fully automated parts:

| Part | Purpose | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1. Scrape & Store Companies | Pull companies from Apollo and log them in Airtable. | JSON nodes Webhook → Apollo Lead Scraper → Remove Duplicates → Add Leads to CRM |
| 2. Qualify ➜ Enrich ➜ Verify | Check ICP fit, extract decision‑makers from LinkedIn Sales Navigator, fetch & verify emails, then write final lead rows. | JSON nodes Comp. LinkedIn → Match For TrueTerpenes → Sales Nav Scraper → Bulk Email Finder → CSV To List – Verified Only → Create Record and transcript walk‑through |

## 2 | Components & Accounts Needed

| Layer | Tool / API |
|-------|------------|
| Orchestrator | n8n (self‑host or cloud) |
| Scraping Runtime | Apify actors (Apollo companies & Sales Navigator people) |
| Data Sources | Apollo.io, LinkedIn Sales Navigator |
| Storage & Triggers | Airtable (Companies & Leads tables) |
| AI Processing | OpenAI GPT‑4o‑mini (three prompt nodes) |
| Email Finder | AnymailFinder bulk endpoint |

**Credentials to enter**: Apify token, OpenAI key, AnymailFinder key, Airtable PAT, LinkedIn cookie (in Apify actor input)

## 3 | Schema & Trigger Boxes

### 3.1 Companies Table

| Field | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Keyword, Location | Inputs for Apollo query |
| Start Scraping ✔️ | Triggers Part 1 |
| Start Enrichment ✔️ | Triggers Part 2 |
| Enrichment Status | To Do / Enriched / Not Qualified / No DM / No Email |
| Data columns | Company Name, Website, LinkedIn URL, UID, Employees, Location |

### 3.2 Leads Table

Minimal: First Name, Email, Title, LinkedIn URL, Company, Website, Location.

## 4 | Step‑by‑Step Flow (JSON nodes mapped to transcript)

### 4.1 Part 1 – Scraping Companies

| # | Node (JSON) | Transcript reference |
|---|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Webhook | "checkbox is checked in Airtable … triggers a webhook" |
| 2 | Get Company From Airtable | pulls keyword & location |
| 3 | Apollo Lead Scraper (HTTP) | "sends the request to the Apollo scraper kicking off the extraction" |
| 4 | Retrieve Dataset → Verify Dataset Availability → Wait | handles Apify delay: "system first attempts … output empty … wait node" |
| 5 | Remove Duplicates | "leads go through a deduplication process" |
| 6 | Add Leads to CRM (Airtable create) | inserts company rows |
| 7 | Update checkbox + date (implicit) | "checkbox … unchecked automatically and the current date is stored" |

**Outcome**: Fresh, unique companies with Start Enrichment still unchecked.

### 4.2 Part 2 – Qualify, Enrich & Verify

**Trigger**: User ticks Start Enrichment on chosen companies.

| Phase | Node chain | Key transcript insight |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| A. ICP Check | Comp. LinkedIn → Filter HTML → Match For TrueTerpenes (LLM) → TT Match? (If) | "retrieve the about us section … AI model determines if company aligns with ICP" |
| B. Standardise & Size Split | Identify Exact Company Name (LLM) → Define Company Size (Code) → Company Size Range (Switch) | ensures Sales Nav query is accurate and branches Small vs Large companies |
| C. Sales Nav Scrape | Scrape Sales Nav Employees (HTTP) | Small: all staff; Large: seniority filter |
| D. Decision‑Maker AI Filter | Merge Employees (Code) → Determine Decision Makers (LLM) → DM Available? | "AI model analyzes job titles … only most relevant decision makers" |
| E. Bulk Email Lookup | Bulk Email Finder (HTTP) → Wait 1 min → Download Emails CSV → Turn JSON Into String → CSV To List – Verified Only (LLM) → Verified Emails? | waits for AnymailFinder async job, filters only verified:"yes" |
| F. Write Leads & Update Status | Split Out → Create Record (Airtable Leads); failure paths update Enrichment Status | "each verified contact is processed separately … leads are uploaded to Airtable" |

## 5 | Built‑In Guard‑Rails

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Empty dataset / 429 | Poll‑wait loop before processing |
| Duplicate companies | n8n Remove Duplicates node |
| Wasting credits on unfit leads | ICP LLM gate before any Sales Nav/API calls |
| No decision maker | Branch tags No DM and exits |
| Bad emails | Only verified:"yes" rows make it through; others mark No Email |

## 6 | Business Impact

| Metric (per 100 verified contacts) | Manual process | Automated flow |
|----------------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Research hours | 8‑10 h | < 15 min compute |
| Cost / lead (labour + tools) | $7‑10 | $0.50 |
| Email bounce rate | ~15 % | < 3 % |
| SDR time on admin | 60 % | 0 % (all on closing deals) |

**Result**: 3‑4× pipeline growth with the same team headcount.

## 7 | Example Run ("Cannabis Vape" Keyword)

Add row: Keyword: cannabis vape, Location: United States, tick Start Scraping.

200 brands appear in Companies.

Tick Start Enrichment on 50; Part 2 qualifies 47, finds 73 verified VP/Director emails.

Outreach campaign fires the same day; reps see 35 % reply rate.

## 8 | Deployment Checklist

1. Import the JSON into n8n.
2. Insert API keys (Apify, OpenAI, AnymailFinder, Airtable PAT).
3. Add LinkedIn cookie to each Apify actor input.
4. Create Airtable automations to POST record ID to the two webhooks when boxes are checked.
5. Test with a single keyword row; verify companies populate, then enrichment writes leads.
6. Scale by adding more keyword/location rows or scheduling checkbox checks via Airtable automation.
