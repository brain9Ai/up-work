hi my name is Clarence I run a lead generation agency that brings in over $35,000 in profit each month but there is even a kicker I don't spend hours grinding away at my desk to make this happen instead I've built an automated system using n8n that finds warm leads personalizes Outreach and books clients for me at skill in today's video I'm going to pull back the curtain and show you exactly how this system works and how you can use it to transform your business too let me start with a question have you ever felt like finding

quality leads is one of the hardest parts of growing your business well you're definitely not alone like many businesses waste hours even weeks chasing Cod prospects who were never really interested in their services to begin with traditional methods like blasting generic emails to massive lists just don't work anymore I'm not sure if they've ever worked however they're timec consuming inefficient and let's face it they often lead to dismal results I've been there but the good news is there's a much smarter way to do

things what I've noticed is that a lot of people approach lead generation all wrong they'll Target very generic and they'll Target prospects based on service level metrics like job titles or company size for example they might to decide to reach out to all marketing directors at companies with over 500 employees you might be wondering well what's wrong with that well the problem is that this approach doesn't take into account whether these businesses actually need your services meaning you end up spending time and resources on on

people who don't even know they have a problem or Worse aren't interested in solving it so of course you're wondering well how do I fix this well you fix this by flipping the script so instead of a wi net focus on companies that are already showing signs of a specific need I'll show you what I mean if you run a sales agency look just like I do don't just Target decision makers but Target businesses that are actively hiring for sales development Representatives like sdrs because you know they're on the

lookout to expand their sales team why do this well because companies investing in these roles are clearly focused on improving their sales process they're much more likely to see value in what you offer it's all about identifying pain points like for instance a company hiring an SEO specialist is likely struggling with we performance the same goes for a business looking for a new CTO they may have technical infrastructure challenges which if that's what you solve that's a perfect time to step in by focusing on these

signals like job post things on LinkedIn or indeed you can tailor your Outreach to address their specific needs this makes your message not just relevant but it makes it irresistible okay you guys probably have had enough of me rambling let's dive into the workflow uh what you can see on screen is a workflow that I've personally used to this day to get me quite a lot of clients because as I said I'm targeting pain points I'm targeting people who are actively looking uh to make a change you're actively looking to hire people to do

the things that I can do for them them so that's the perfect time to step in the workflow is quite long that's because there are some tricky parts that's why I've tried to breaking down into five different segments first we'll scrape companies who are actively hiring for certain roles well in this case I'm using sdrs as an example then we'll have to find their email address because that isn't part of the job application we'll have to enrich the lead use AR to personalize and then lastly write an

email and send the email let's start at the beginning we scrape for companies hiring for sdrs we scrape LinkedIn because LinkedIn is one of the platforms just like indeed where most companies post job applications if they have some but as you can see there are 3,000 United States looking for an SDR so plenty of people for us to reach out to problem with doing this manually that's going to be very timec consuming that's why we made this part of the automation to scrape the list of companies and jobs

you just saw I use a scraper which can be found on apify for those who aren't familiar apify is a giant Marketplace for scrapers you've seen a video of me using it for an Apollo scraper but you can also have an Instagram scraper Facebook post scraper stereo scraper G2 scraper crunch space scraper you name it it's probably on here so how to get the scraper to work is actually quite simple it should have only taken two notes which is this HTTP note which is set to post and this one which is set to get

but there are some other things I had to add to this flow to make it work without any manual input I'll get to that in a second first let me show you how you can actually trigger the scraper to trigger the scraper we use an API for those who aren't familiar an API is simply like a bridge between two systems which lets one system which is our automation dog with another one which is the scraper for that all we need is a URL I found you can find this URL on the AP in the a API API documentation it's very

straightforward so I won't go over it uh in any detail a thing to note is that what you see here I'll highlight it for you is the the ID of the scraper so each scraper has their own ID of course and this just tells the API API which actor it has to communicate with so once you sent the trigger to the scraper to start running all we have to do is retrieve the data retrieve the data set for that we use a variable which is also an ID you can see it it's this number it's a variable because each run of the scraper

you do the data set ID is going to be different so it needs to be a variable um you can see that only on the first and second run there was no information to be outputed meaning data wasn't ready yet only the third run there actually was some so once this HTTP note is done which literally takes a split second because all it has to do is like send a trigger to a URL this note is immediately activated and is told to retrieve the data but 9 out of 10 times the data is isn't going to be ready in a split second because the scraper needs

to start running and needs to finish which can take a while depending on what you're asking from it that's why these four nodes here are in place so as I just showed inside of this HTTP note you can see that the first two runs were dots so if that's the case this code node just checks if there's an output if there isn't one it'll send out not ready as you can see the status is not ready then it goes to this if note which checks if not ready is present well if it isn't present uh it's told to wait

and then rerun the flow until there's actually some data to be retrieved and we can continue on in this case you can see it took two rounds or three tries actually before the data was ready so now you know why even though triggering an API and retrieving the data is very straightforward there were some necessary additions to this part of the flow which also concludes the first section don't worry the other ones won't take as long now we need to find find the email address we find the email address by using some very useful

software called anyil finder anyil finder is accessible also through an API which is why we can link it to our workflow what an email finder does is based on a domain it can find email addresses which are linked to that domain so since we don't have the email address of the person who posted the job application on LinkedIn we'll have to just do a domain search and find all email addresses linked to that company let me quickly show you what we actually did retrieve brief because that's what I forgot just now so here you can see the

data set and what it contained I'll show you in a schema so it's clearer for everyone so we have the post ID of the application when it was published in this case the salary isn't present we see the company name we also have the company URL which isn't the URL to the company website but this is the URL to the company LinkedIn page because well the job was posted on LinkedIn and then lastly here it says poster full name um in some some cases there is a name actually here but in most cases I would

say nine out of 10 times there isn't a poster full name uh I think that's due to privacy reasons are just because it isn't like required and the poster full name not being present just makes our job a little bit more difficult but it's still doable and I'll show you how so now you actually know what was retrieved by the scraper from the LinkedIn job post which brings us on to finding the email address well to find the email address and to trigger the API as I just showed we need a domain we haven't found

the domain yet because it wasn't part of the retrieved information so we have to scrape the company LinkedIn profile to find a domain how we do that is by using also HTTP Noe this HTTP Noe gets the company uh LinkedIn profile HTML so it's just I took this from the left and pasted it over there and it retrieved us the HTML as always we want to clean this because this contains a lot of code and a lot of unnecessary stuff for just uh increases the amount of input tokens into the LM which is something we don't

want that's why this code is present all this code does is filter out uh HTML as you can see on the left side it was very dirty as I like to call it and on the left on the right side All That Remains is plain text readable for us and also easier for the llm then somewhere on the page so somewhere within this line of text there isn't really somewhere in here there is the domain name and URL of the company so what I've done is I've written a prompt to kind of analyze this text and based on the company name find

me the most likely URL The Prompt is very straightforward based on the provided LinkedIn content identify the company name and locate the website URL only output the URL as input we've given it the plain text from the left side and directag it in once again and you can see on the right side the output side that it has found for us the URL to the company homepage which we canot only use to enrich but we actually need to find email addresses linked to this domain so as I mentioned before in some cases the

LinkedIn application is present in most cases it isn't if it is present it just makes your life a bit easier because you can do a more specific search using any mfinder if it isn't present all we have to work with is the domain so what we do is we take the domain which was hatch.com which was because the result from the large language model you can see over here input it and it returns us all of the email addresses which are linked to or are using this domain you can see the entire list there is a total

of 8,000 now that we've found all of these email addresses that kind of concludes the second part and all that's left is to enrich the lead so give the large language model some information about the company write a little personalization and clean up the company name if necessary and then lastly send it email to the person how do we enrich the lead well we enrich the lead with the only information we have at this point which is their website URL so we fetch all of the HTML this time instead of from the LinkedIn profile page we do

this from the company website from their homepage this is the same code as I inputed over here it just filters the HTML and returns plain text as you can see so this is what's on their homepage for analyzing the homepage I just use cat GP T 40 mini I think it's more than capable and it's very inexpensive thought people told me about deep seek but I haven't had the time to experiment with it this is a very generic prompt I wrote with the assistance of Chad GPT uh but you can use as a foundation because

it works perfectly fine and then onto the questions that I'm asking it to answer so I'm asking it to extract and organize following information testimonials recent growth and success stories uh and on the right side you can see what the output is well apparently they there were no testimonials on the homepage there was some recent growth and there were some success stories which is more than enough for us to write a personalization uh which we can use as email opener and then once again as input as I probably already mentioned

I take I plain text from the left so you might be wondering why are you cleaning the company name and what does that mean well in some cases um the job application post on LinkedIn contains the company name which is like followed by limited or by Inc for example how they're registered the thing is you never want to use that in a called email because it doesn't sound human at all I would never reference to a company saying Tesla Inc for example that's why we use this well in this case hatch was already cleaned but if that isn't the

case it would just take it out so let's say LL C was present or ink was present or limited as I just said it would just clean the company name so we can use a clean version of it in the email then we're on to the second to last large language model why do we need to get the first name well if you remember back to where we found the email addresses the email addresses contained a first name a last name and a domain name we want to give the large language model the easiest job possible to make its output

as consistent as possible that's why we need this extra step to take what we just got so we take the entire email address which is once again input from the left side which this variable actually translates into this and we just ask it to return the first name if it's present if it isn't leave the field empty because you'd rather say hi to someone than say hi s at whatever because then you you already know they're not going to respond to your email and you can see the output is Stewart because his email address was

stewart. mcer so this was a very easy cleanup which brings us on to writing the email while writing the email might be giving it a bit more credit than it deserves because I always just tell the llm to fill in a pre-written template why do I choose to pre-write an email template instead of let cat GPT write everything that's because in my opinion CAD GPT or clot or whatever you use isn't good enough to write an entire email that's pretty big part of it the other part of it is that if you're doing

C outbound if you're doing cold emailing or if you're doing any Outreach as a business you constantly want to improve and how do you improve you improve by switching up variables well if you constantly let the llm write the entire email you can be sure that each and every email is going to be completely different from the one before so there aren't really any metrics to test because there aren't any consistencies between the emails so you can't really test your offer you can't test the layout because you have no say over it

because the llm is filling that in for you that's why we want to take away that power the llm keep it to ourselves and just let it write let it fill in the variables or let it fill in the blanks which it is really good at so before I go over the conclusion of this entire workflow let me show you what the input was so the input was the first name the company name and the result the result is simply what we extracted from the homepage and here is the prompt as I already said I wanted to fill in a

template using placeholder for personalization and I just gave it some notes on the tone which brings us to what you guys have all been waiting for probably is uh the result of all of her hard work which is a filled-in email template and I'll just read it to you guys briefly hey Stewart which is the first name we retrieved a friend mentioned hatch recently and I've been meeting to reach out sounds like you're making big moves and then here it is followed by the personalization congrats on the initiatives related to

decarbonization engineering solutions for the battery life cycle by the way which is probably something hatch is involved with well it must be because it was on our website so you've got some SDR roles open and figured I drop you a note this is the the best part of the email because they actually have some jobs open because we verified so we know they're looking for this so we know this email is relevant to them and then we just talked something about ourselves iRun agency specialized in called

outbound and we can handle Outreach at 50 times the base of a typical SDR which is true there is no human who can compete with a flow like this Furthermore with response rates consistently outperforming industry averages we've helped companies like bolt and livero create over 8 million in pipeline would love to to explore if we could do the same for you free for quick chat this week cheers clearance this is one of the best email templates I've ever written and this is one which works like a charm I would highly suggest to

just copy this one use it for yourself and see the positive replies flow in and let me tell you that using this system completely changed the game for me using this exact system I grew my agency from $0 a month to $35,000 in monthly profits within just six months and the best part of it all is because AI does all the heavy lifting I now work just 3 to four hours a day because this system handles everything it resulted in me not having to worry about where my next lead or my next payment is coming from because I have a

consistent lead which is constantly updating with ready to buy clients who are interested in my services so if you're tired of outdated methods that waste your time and bring in little to no results it is time to take action because there are possibilities you can start by building this automated workflow today and unlock a whole whole new level of efficiency for your business if anything was unclear or if you got any questions drop them in the comments below I'd love to help you out dive deeper into any part of the system
