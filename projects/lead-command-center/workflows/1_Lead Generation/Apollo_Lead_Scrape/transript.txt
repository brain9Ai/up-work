I'll be explaining in detail how you can copy these Sales Systems for yourself to grow your business as I just said the response on the last video was amazing there has been definitely a lot of interest from you guys from the community when it comes to learning how to set up these automated SE systems in this video I'll be very practical I'll explain quite directly how you can get almost unlimited highly targeted lead lists for that you'll need three things uh and I'll be going over them more specifically later on but first let me

name them for you first of all you need N1 which is the automation software I use in all of my videos I personally think it is the best automation software out there I highly recommend it this is not a SP I'm not sponsored at all this is not an affiliate link I just think it's the best and I want you guys to get started with the best secondly to get the leads from somewhere you need a database for that database we use Apollo or we will be using Apollo Apollo can best be summarized as a giant LinkedIn

profile database I honestly think most business profiles available on LinkedIn are also available on Apollo and it allows you to search and filter for the ideal Target you want to send emails or to or call then lastly we will need to extract these profiles or these leads from Apollo for that we'll need a scraper apify is like an online Marketplace which provides a lot of scrapers uh which also provides a scraper that I use which is literally called Apollo lead scraper using the scraper will save you of manual work

down the line and it will perfectly work with the automation you can see on screen already if you're familiar with n then you can see that I've already done a test run I have done this test run so I can quickly go over the automation for you guys to explain how it works before diving into the other software which I just talked about which was apify and Apollo so let's quickly go over the workflow and then get on to the juicier stuff so since we'll be using an API we need HTTP request noes and in this case

we'll be needing two one to fire the API and want to retrieve the data from the API so the first one is a post because we want to get it started you'll need to copy this URL this is also in the API documentation so don't worry you don't have to write it down manually you can just look up the API documentation online this part of the URL is the ID of the scraper so if you use a different scraper or just if you want to use a different apy scraper at all this will be a variable then you'll need to fill in the

headers the headers is just the authorization kind of like the permission you have to use the app in apify here will usually be your API key but for the purpose of this video I've removed my API key because it's the personal one I use just so you know this is where you fill in the API key and then lastly you'll have some Json code this might look a bit frightening but please don't worry this is straight up copied from the epifi um I'll show you the epifi page later on this video this is really nothing to worry about the only

important thing to take from this is the search URL um the search URL is what you get from filtering inside of Apollo so this yet again again is also not something to worry about um if we're in Apollo I'll show you how to filter and search for your ideal leads based on whatever you're looking for and then you can just literally copy the URL paste it here to get scraping on the lead list you want so a thing to note is that to the API scraper can take quite a while depending on how big your Apollo list is

so let's say you have found 10,000 people inside of AP poloo which you want to email or phone so you want to extract those 10,000 profiles this API scraper or this scraper excuse me might take up to 10 15 minutes so you can set a timer so you can set a weight note for example but that's never really that never really works because you don't know how long exactly it's going to take so this is a manual part mostly I just watched inside of epifi where you can see the run where you can see if it's completed

if it's still running if there are any errors before I manually press a run note on the get request I know I'm always talking about automations but but to keep this as simple as possible I think this is just a manual step you press on this one open apify check after 10 15 minutes get a drink yourself come back see if it's completed then click on this one to get all the results in this case it was a very quick one I only got 50 results as you can see on the output side the right side did outputs the

information before I forget yet again you'll also need a URL as you can see in highlighted in green this is a variable it's the data set ID the data set ID is uh new every time you do a run because it's specific to the run you did so it needs to be a variable just so you know if you guys get mixed up and on the right side you can see all the output so I was specifically looking for Founders and co-founders so Felix Rosen I don't want to get any privacy issues here but you know what I mean the co-founder his

email address organization ID whatever where he's from so on so on as you can see there is a ton of information you can extract which is also it brings me on to my next point it's way too much information it's you don't need anything everything for a CRM or later down the line that's why we use this edit Fields note in this edit Fields note as you can see as I've organized it quite neatly you give titles to the things you want so I want their first name I want their full name their LinkedIn URL so I can

later down line enrich it I want their title stuff like that so I know who I'm talking to I've also included their location uh and uh employment history zero is their most recent employment history um so that's all that's all almost always the thing they're doing now or the business they're working for now in this case I'm targeting founder so this is also almost directly also the founding date of the company which might be interesting for you to know that's why I've included it as you can see on

the left is everything we extracted from Apollo using the scraper it's way too much but you can just filter this by let me give you guys an example so let's say you want the LinkedIn URL just like me you just drag it from the left paste it here and that's done so you do this for each individual thing you want to extract out of the data then it goes through a well it's not new anymore it's like a two-month old note which n introduced which remove D removes duplicates as it says down here this is really straightforward it

has a memory from previous runs and of course you want to keep your CRM as need as possible so let's say you do 10 runs and sometimes you get duplicate leads this one will make sure only the ones who haven't been through here are kept and the other ones will be discarded so they won't be added to your CRM which is the final step it just keeps your CRM clean and you also don't want to be emailing the same person with the same offer multiple times because they'll just Market a Spam and that will hurt

your deliverability uh and just the quality of your email accounts in the long run and then lastly I use air table CRM I think for me it's the best option it's very easy to work with in these n andn automations but you can use whatever CRM you are already using or you prefer to use in the future the only thing it needs is an API which I'm sure most have so as promised this workflow was short and sweet you can copy it quickly and easily for yourself and just just fill in the things like the personal

information you need now we'll quickly dive into apify and I'll show you which scraper I used how you can copy the Json what you need to fill in and that's and where you can find the rest of the documentation so here in apy I use the apollo.io lead scraper by curious coder it's $45 a month the thing is you can get a trial for I think 3 Days To kind of set it up for yourself test it out if it's something you like for the attentive viewer these this what's here in the cookies is the same thing you saw

in ad Json code so you just copy and paste this this is where you paste the search URL well it's very obvious we want emails because we want to contact the people we have scraped and we also want to wait for email verification there is the option within Apollo to only extract profiles which with verified emails which you'll definitely want to tick because otherwise your emails Just Bounce or they'll go nowhere which once again will he will hurt your deliverability I always do a th000 records maximum there's no real reason

why I go for a th000 maximum you can do this to whatever you want you can also leave it empty to scrape all the leads you found I just think doing a th at a time is enough it also takes like 10 15 minutes and if there's an error you can fix it and then lastly for a proxy which is necessary and it's also free so if you're using this one I would definitely set it up I always use residential and just use anywhere you can use this is because let's say you're not using a proxy and you're always doing it from

the same IP address Apollo might flag your account because you're kind of doing something which is not against the rules but it's a bit of a gray area they want you to extract the leads manually and are not really in favor of using a scraper otherwise they would have made it easier for you so once you filled all this in and once you filled in the URL which once again you get after filtering in Apollo you just click on Json copy all paste this into the n8n workflow more specifically the HTTP post note

under the code which is all the way at the bottom and you're good to go now that apify is clear to everyone let's go over to Apollo which in my opinion is the most interesting part of this video so firstly I'll quickly show you the pricing because I for people there getting started it's of course a very important thing same as the Apollo scraper there is also a trial version of Apollo which is free it gives you 1,200 credits a year which means you can extract 12200 leads which is more than enough to get started but after you've

used those 1,200 credits you can go over to the basic plan which is just $49 a month the basic plan allows you to scrape or extract 60,000 profiles which is way more than you'll need to get your first clients or way more that you than you'll need to actually scale your business so it is really affordable that's one thing I like because it's not it's affordable but it's also amazing now that we've covered the boring stuff like the pricing let's get into Apollo itself so as I mentioned Apollo is just

a giant database of most if not all of the business LinkedIn LinkedIn business profiles as you can see up here there are over 200 Million results of course not all 200 million results are interesting for you and instead of emailing everyone you want to be more specific and we want to be more specifically targeting decision makers because decision makers are at the end of the day the people who are actually entitled to do business with you and they are the ones who will be signing off on any of your invoices so to do

that you can filter job titles I always do like CEO and founder as you can now see this includes everyone who has co-founder and CEO or founder and CEO in their title so you're more than sure that you'll be talking to decision makers then for email status that's very straightforward you just want likely to engage and verify it because as I said before you only want to send emails to people or or to email addresses which are verified there's other software you can use which I'll go over future videos but just also

tick it in Apollo please do it for me otherwise it'll bounce it'll hurt your deliverability uh and most of your emails will be sent to spam directly instead of to their inbox which is just a waste of your time then for location this is really depending on if you want to do Global business if you want to do business in the EU if you want to do business in the US one thing that I did notice is that it looks at a person's loc person's location not that they age business location so sometimes if you

target us there are some Indian companies or whatever uh which do very little business over there or maybe don't even really speak or don't communicate using English as their first language then employees is one of the more important ones I usually go for 11 to 20 and 21 to 50 because if you go for the 1 to 10 you're talking to very small businesses and for me as someone who wants to skill businesses that can be interesting so also maybe for you but you have to bear in mind that these people or these businesses also have a

lot less to spend and from my experience the people who have more to spend are the best clients are the clients you'll you'll want and you'll need because they always also have a lot less to complaint and they'll be a lot happier as long as you do the job so I always select 11 to 20 and 21 to 50 since I haven't selected a location and this is still World worldwide there are 380,000 leads we can still contact and then for industry and keywords it depends it depends on what your product is so let's say you are in

sales like I am or you're like in lead generation as I am to be more specific you could think of marketing businesses so people who do e-commerce marketing for b2c businesses they're always looking for more clients because that's what their entire business model depends on so you can Target them offer them that you'll take on the the entire outbound process and just get them ready to buy highly interested leads for a fee fixed fee a month and you can do this for everything I mean you can do this for accounting

for B2B accounting businesses the list is endless and as I said it's really dependent or on what kind of offer of what kind of services you as your and your business provide and then lastly revenue revenue is a lot less specific so um if you press on is known only have like a third of the companies the revenue is known so what I've seen a lot of other people or what I've seen some other people do is say like they want a minimum of like 5 million so the revenue of the company was 5 million in a year but the the only thing you forget

is that like there might be a lot more companies which Revenue was 5 million or more a year but since it isn't known you'll be excluding them automatically so I leave this open but for a more specific search let's say you're only interested in very high Revenue targets because you sell a very expensive product or service you can definitely use it that's why I wanted to highlight once all the filters are f are filled out as I said before you just go over to the URL up top which you can see it's just above my screen

recording you cop and paste that URL into the NN post note all the way at the bottom as I showed earlier in this video you can press start and you're ready to go after just a few short minutes you'll have your CRM filled with thousands of leads which you can enrich in future videos I'll be going over how you can use AI to enrich these leads which not only makes it 10 times more efficient but also makes it a lot better than humans do because AI doesn't forget well that's it for today uh I want to thank

everyone for watching if you've watched to the end don't forget to leave a like And subscribe uh and I'll see you in the next one bye
