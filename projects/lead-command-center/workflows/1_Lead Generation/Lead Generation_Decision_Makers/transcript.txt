Are scraping Isn't very useful the only thing We Need Is Their Company name en from the social links we need Their Company LinkedIn URL because Without this URL We Can't Do Any Further Research that is we ADD ife immediately scraping Linkin drop Le Never makes CRM this ensur we Only Working with leads we can actually Use inad oftering the System with incomplete data let's take a Quick Look Again at the http Request Note and Let Me Show You The Body parameters So What is happening Here URL isar Digital

marketing agencies in the US on That are verified As you can see by the True Which means they've paid for Clutch For Better rankings and That ensur We Are Only scraping companies actively investing in lead Generation we're limiting it to three items for now just for testing and we using apice proxy service to avoid Getting blocked finally we're exclude unnecessary data like the reviews and the portfolio since we don't need Those for lead Generation At All Now let's take a look Again at the output you can see that Every Company we

pulled Is verified You can see It over here premere verified and you already Saw that they Had A LinkedIn Profile Attached over here otherwise They would have Made It past the filter from Here The Next Step is storing this data in air table and we're Keeping It super Easy we're Only saving two Key pieces of data The Company name and the LinkedIn Company URL That Is It No unnecessary clutter Just the Essentials we need to move forward alri Now that we've Scrap Clutch And filtered For verified companies Let's Jump over to airtable

and see exactly how the data Is stored as you can see we're Only Keeping The Company name And The Company LinkedIn URL each record contains Just Those two things no unnecessary data Just the Essentials for Moving forward You also notice that the Lead stat colum is yet to be enriched because at this Point we Only confirmed that These companies are verified and have a LinkedIn Profile Now Here is where the automation kicks in youl see this start lead enrichment checkbox in the table The Moment I check

this box the next part of the workflow automatically starts that means as soon as I decide I want to move forward with a lead The System kicks off the next process scraping LinkedIn identifying Decision Makers and pulling verified emails Without Me having to do anything manually alr Now That We have or verified companies loaded into Air table it's time to take things a step further right now we Only have the Company name and LinkedIn Profile but what we really Need are Decision Makers details and

verified emails for outreach of course instead of manually searching for contacts this second part of the workflow does everything automatically scraping LinkedIn identifying Key employees and verifying Their emails All on autopilot so Let Me break down exactly how it works Everything starts Inside Air table As I Just showed you if I decide I want to enrich lead All I have to do is check The Start enrichment box The Moment I do that a webhook triggers activating the entire workflow the webhook receives the record ID of

that specific lead en from the Lead record error table It sends Everything over so we have all the information That We have well in this case Only The Company name and the company's LinkedIn URL Inside Of n8n so we can start gathering More data since we already stored The LinkedIn Company Profile during the first fas of lead scraping the first Real Step In This workflow Is Simply retrieving that URL As I just Said we Use the record ID received by the webhook in the air table noe To receive The Company LinkedIn Page

Meaning we're Only enriching companies That We Can actually Research further Now That We have the Company LinkedIn URL Inside Of Our workflow we use a http Request For The Company LinkedIn URL to scrape the HTML Which pulls all the available data from the company's LinkedIn page The HTML you see Here on the right Side includes details like the company's website URL The about section The Company size The Industry in the location operating from and Any other Public information listed on Profile at

this stage We're Just gathering raw data and this includes the entire HTML structure of the page of course There is also a lot Inside Of this HTML Which we don't need That's Why We will be Cleaning It Up using a code noe Because We Are scraping The entire webpage The data is messy Full of HTML tags unnecessary formatting en extra text We Don't don't need so Before doing Anything Else we run a code noe that removes all HTML and Leaves Us with Clean structur data As you can see on the right Side of your screen Now That

We have a clean Company Profile It is time to start later on to Fight verified emails As I just Said So What this llm does Is It extracts the company's website That Is Hidden Somewhere Inside of the text from the company's LinkedIn page and it Returns Us The Full HTML Which you can see on the outside in this case It is http www. tchic Co later on in this Flow we be Cleaning this up because All We actually Need Is the domain part so technical Go we Won't be using a llm for that wel Just Be using A Simple

expression When the time Comes Why we need the domain name is very important because most Corporate emails Follow a Standard structure like First name at Company name en Company name is Their domain name and without the correct root domain we Wouldn't be able to accurately find and verify Their emails later in the process Now That We have the Company domain The Next Step is pulling Their Industry and Their location even though this information Isn't necessary for Finding emails It is Something We always

use for lead qualification in another Flow so we use this llm node to extract The Industry so we can Segment or leads based on what kind of business They are and we use it to extract Their location because geography Often plays a Role in our outre strategy by storing Everything in our CRM we're making sure that When It's Time To launch or outreach we already have everything filter qualify and personal Skill Now That We have the Company details It is time to find the right People The Decision Makers to do this we use ap

scraper to scan The companies LinkedIn People page and pull a list of employees working at The Company at this stage We're not filtering by Job title yet we pulling everyone listed on the Company People page we avil employees we later decide Who relevant and is can designation Job title managing director director of operations and we pulled in Their personal LinkedIn profiles Which can also be very useful enrichment in another Flow One issue with scraping employees is that the scraper outputs each person as a separate item you can

see 20 items Meaning 20 employees The workflow suddenly has 20 Different par makes processing morec to Keep Clean we mer All employees into single structured format so that The Next Step we can process Everything in one go instead of dealing with multiple fragmented Records for some Reason die LinkedIn employee scraper Sometimes PS duplicate names Maybe multiple LinkedIn accounts Moving for we filter Out Any repe contacts using LM llm scans through the list checks for duplicate entries and ensure that each employee appears

Only Once at this Point we should Now have a clean list of Unique employees All stored Inside One structured record The Next Step is Running Them through an email finder API to pull verified contact details but Before we do that We Need To Make sure The data is in the right format right now the llm outputs The employee data in a structured json format that is great for storing information but Next Step requires a string format for processing to fix this we run the data through a code noe that converts the json into a structured

string As you can see on the right Side this step enses that When We send the data to the email finder API It can correctly process each employee name and domain without this the API Would Be able recognize input Now for Where The Magic actually happens The Any mafer API Now That We have a formatt list of employees and Company domains It is Time To Run Them through Any mail finders Bulk email search API Just to refresh your memory Any mail finder gives You The Ability To Look for Any email address Connected to a certain domain

and to make your life easier you can also use First and last names plus The domain email inail of decis Makers is very interesting instead of Looking up One contact at a time we're Sending multiple names At Once this allows Us to process as many employees as we want in a single Request Let Me Pull Up The Jason Body we using to make Request ins Request weing employe First name and Their last name and we're passing The domain as a request to find and verify the best available email Once This is sent The API searches Its

database and uses pattern recognition to find the most likely and deliverable email addresses for each person doing a Bulk search using The Any mail finder API takes a while It depends It really depends so the easiest way to get Around This Is using Because We retrieve The data immediately SO instead of Moving forward directly The we Note takes A few Seconds to complete it not a Long delay and this is the easiest way to Handle book requests Without Running into timing issues Once the API completes Its search we download

The CSV file containing The results Now If Any emails were Found we officially have Them Inside Our workflow Ready For filtering validation at this stage we not finished we need to make we using verified emails adding Them To Our CRM you can see the verified Inside Of The CSV file This one Is verified This one is verified having Found The potential email addresses The Next Step is making we Only Keeping verified High quity contacts And For That We use a llm at this stage we a CSV file with all emails Api returned

deliverability we scs and removes Any unverified emails The Final output is a clean list of verified High leads People we confidently Reach previous llm and told it to output the entire contact details of each person So you can Now see that we have the Decision Makers full name Derek rubenstein we have an email address we have the Connected domain They are verified we have Their personal LinkedIn URL and we have Their designation or Their Job title This is everything We Could Ever Need for highly targeted

outreach Now That We have a clean list of verified leads The Next Step is making we actually upload Them To Our CRM The issue is that the llm output All leads in one batch Meaning everything is packed Together into a single item to fix this we use a simple split Note that Breaks Them into individual Records making Them easy to process in The Next Step finally Now that everything is structured correctly we send the enrich leads back to A Table each lead is updated with Their First name Their last

name Their email address Their title IND location personal LinkedIn URL Company website Now Let Me Jump over to air table to show you How This actually looks so instead of Just having a company name and a company LinkedIn URL we Now have a full Profile of the Decision Makers complete with verified contact details means We Lead qualification valid anding Out To can Company teal Conta of managing director director of operations chief revenue Officer account manager en director of client success plenty for us to start with And
